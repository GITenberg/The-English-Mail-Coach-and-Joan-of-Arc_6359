      Some portions of this Introduction have been taken from the Athenæum Press

      If a word by way of suggestion to teachers be pertinent, I would venture
      to remark that the object of the teacher of literature is, of course, only
      to fulfill the desire of the author&mdash;to make clear his facts and to
      bring home his ideas in all their power and beauty. Introductions and
      notes are only means to this end. Teachers, I think, sometimes lose sight
      of this fact; I know it is fatally easy for students to forget it. That
      teacher will have rendered a great service who has kept his pupils alive
      to the real aim of their studies,&mdash;to know the author, not to know of
      him.

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I. LIFE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Thomas de Quincey was born in Manchester on the 15th of August, 1785. His
      father was a man of high character and great taste for literature as well
      as a successful man of business; he died, most unfortunately, when Thomas
      was quite young. Very soon after our author's birth the family removed to
      The Farm, and later to Greenhay, a larger country place near Manchester.
      In 1796 De Quincey's mother, now for some years a widow, removed to Bath
      and placed him in the grammar school there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas, the future opium-eater, was a weak and sickly child. His first
      years were spent in solitude, and when his elder brother, William, a real
      boy, came home, the young author followed in humility mingled with terror
      the diversions of that ingenious and pugnacious "son of eternal racket."
      De Quincey's mother was a woman of strong character and emotions, as well
      as excellent mind, but she was excessively formal, and she seems to have
      inspired more awe than affection in her children, to whom she was for all
      that deeply devoted. Her notions of conduct in general and of child
      rearing in particular were very strict. She took Thomas out of Bath
      School, after three years' excellent work there, because he was too much
      praised, and kept him for a year at an inferior school at Winkfield in
      Wiltshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1800, at the age of fifteen, De Quincey was ready for Oxford; he had
      not been praised without reason, for his scholarship was far in advance of
      that of ordinary pupils of his years. "That boy," his master at Bath
      School had said, "that boy could harangue an Athenian mob better than you
      or I could address an English one." He was sent to Manchester Grammar
      School, however, in order that after three years' stay he might secure a
      scholarship at Brasenose College, Oxford. He remained there&mdash;strongly
      protesting against a situation which deprived him "of <i>health</i>, of <i>society</i>,
      of <i>amusement</i>, of <i>liberty</i>, of <i>congeniality of pursuits</i>"&mdash;for
      nineteen months, and then ran away.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first plan had been to reach Wordsworth, whose <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>
      (1798) had solaced him in fits of melancholy and had awakened in him a
      deep reverence for the neglected poet. His timidity preventing this, he
      made his way to Chester, where his mother then lived, in the hope of
      seeing a sister; was apprehended by the older members of the family; and
      through the intercession of his uncle, Colonel Penson, received the
      promise of a guinea a week to carry out his later project of a solitary
      tramp through Wales. From July to November, 1802, De Quincey then led a
      wayfarer's life. [Footnote: For a most interesting account of this period
      see the <i>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i>, Athenæum Press <i>Selections
      from De Quincey</i>, pp. 165-171, and notes.] He soon lost his guinea,
      however, by ceasing to keep his family informed of his whereabouts, and
      subsisted for a time with great difficulty. Still apparently fearing
      pursuit, with a little borrowed money he broke away entirely from his home
      by exchanging the solitude of Wales for the greater wilderness of London.
      Failing there to raise money on his expected patrimony, he for some time
      deliberately clung to a life of degradation and starvation rather than
      return to his lawful governors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discovered by chance by his friends, De Quincey was brought home and
      finally allowed (1803) to go to Worcester College, Oxford, on a reduced
      income. Here, we are told, "he came to be looked upon as a strange being
      who associated with no one." During this time he learned to take opium. He
      left, apparently about 1807, without a degree. In the same year he made
      the acquaintance of Coleridge and Wordsworth; Lamb he had sought out in
      London several years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      His acquaintance with Wordsworth led to his settlement in 1809 at
      Grasmere, in the beautiful English Lake District; his home for ten years
      was Dove Cottage, which Wordsworth had occupied for several years and
      which is now held in trust as a memorial of the poet. De Quincey was
      married in 1816, and soon after, his patrimony having been exhausted, he
      took up literary work in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1821 he went to London to dispose of some translations from German
      authors, but was persuaded first to write and publish an account of his
      opium experiences, which accordingly appeared in the <i>London Magazine</i>
      in that year. This new sensation eclipsed Lamb's <i>Essays of Elia</i>,
      which were appearing in the same periodical. The <i>Confessions of an
      English Opium-Eater</i> was forthwith published in book form. De Quincey
      now made literary acquaintances. Tom Hood found the shrinking author "at
      home in a German ocean of literature, in a storm, flooding all the floor,
      the tables, and the chairs&mdash;billows of books." Richard Woodhouse
      speaks of the "depth and reality of his knowledge. ... His conversation
      appeared like the elaboration of a mine of results. ... Taylor led him
      into political economy, into the Greek and Latin accents, into
      antiquities, Roman roads, old castles, the origin and analogy of
      languages; upon all these he was informed to considerable minuteness. The
      same with regard to Shakespeare's sonnets, Spenser's minor poems, and the
      great writers and characters of Elizabeth's age and those of Cromwell's
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time on De Quincey maintained himself by contributing to various
      magazines. He soon exchanged London and the Lakes for Edinburgh and its
      suburb, Lasswade, where the remainder of his life was spent. <i>Blackwood's
      Edinburgh Magazine</i> and its rival <i>Tatt's Magazine</i> received a
      large number of contributions. <i>The English Mail-Coach</i> appeared in
      1849 in Blackwood. <i>Joan of Arc</i> had already been published (1847) in
      <i>Tait</i>. De Quincey continued to drink laudanum throughout his life,&mdash;twice
      after 1821 in very great excess. During his last years he nearly completed
      a collected edition of his works. He died in Edinburgh on the 8th of
      December, 1859.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II. CRITICAL REMARKS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Opium-Eater had been a weak, lonely, and over-studious child, and he
      was a solitary and ill-developed man. His character and his work present
      strange contradictions. He is most precise in statement, yet often very
      careless of fact; he is most courteous in manner, yet inexcusably
      inconsiderate in his behavior. Again, he sets up a high standard of purity
      of diction, yet uses slang quite unnecessarily and inappropriately; and
      though a great master of style, he is guilty, at times, of digression
      within digression until all trace of the original subject is lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Quincey divides his writings into three groups: first, that class which
      "proposes primarily to amuse the reader, but which, in doing so, may or
      may not happen occasionally to reach a higher station, at which the
      amusement passes into an impassioned interest." To this class would belong
      the <i>Autobiographic Sketches</i> and the <i>Literary Reminiscences</i>.
      As a second class he groups "those papers which address themselves purely
      to the understanding as an insulated faculty, or do so primarily." These
      essays would include, according to Professor Masson's subdivision, (a)
      Biographies, such as <i>Shakespeare</i> or <i>Pope</i>&mdash;<i>Joan of
      Arc</i> falls here, yet has some claim to a place in the first class; (b)
      Historical essays, like The <i>Cæsars</i>; (c) Speculative and Theological
      essays; (d) Essays in Political Economy and Politics; (e) Papers of
      Literary Theory and Criticism, such as the brilliant discussions of <i>Rhetoric,
      Style</i>, and <i>Conversation</i>, and the famous <i>On the Knocking at
      the Gate in 'Macbeth</i>.' As a third and "far higher" class the author
      ranks the <i>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i>, and also (but more
      emphatically) the <i>Suspiria de Profundis</i>. "On these," he says, "as
      modes of impassioned prose ranging under no precedents that I am aware of
      in any literature, it is much more difficult to speak justly, whether in a
      hostile or a friendly character."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of De Quincey's essays in general it may be said that they bear witness
      alike to the diversity of his knowledge and the penetrative power of his
      intellect. The wide range of his subjects, however, deprives his papers
      when taken together of the weight which might attach to a series of
      related discussions. And, remarkable as is De Quincey's aptitude for
      analysis and speculation, more than once we have to regret the lack of the
      "saving common-sense" possessed by many far less gifted men. His erudition
      and insight are always a little in advance of his good judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the works of the first class, the <i>Reminiscences</i> are defaced
      by the shrewish spirit shown in the accounts of Wordsworth and other
      friends; nor can we depend upon them as records of fact. But our author
      had had exceptional opportunities to observe these famous men and women,
      and he possessed no little insight into literature and personality. As to
      the <i>Autobiographic Sketches</i>, the handling of events is hopelessly
      arbitrary and fragmentary. In truth, De Quincey is drawing an idealized
      picture of childhood,&mdash;creating a type rather than re-creating a
      person; it is a study of a child of talent that we receive from him, and
      as such these sketches form one of the most satisfactory products of his
      pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Confessions</i> as a narrative is related to the Autobiography,
      while its poetical passages range it with the <i>Suspiria</i> and the <i>Mail-Coach</i>.
      De Quincey seems to have believed that he was creating in such writings a
      new literary type of prose poetry or prose phantasy; he had, with his
      splendid dreams as subject-matter, lifted prose to heights hitherto scaled
      only by the poet. In reality his style owed much to the
      seventeenth-century writers, such as Milton and Sir Thomas Browne. He took
      part with Coleridge, Lamb, and others in the general revival of interest
      in earlier modern English prose, which is a feature of the Romantic
      Movement. Still none of his contemporaries wrote as he did; evidently De
      Quincey has a distinct quality of his own. Ruskin, in our own day, is like
      him, but never the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet De Quincey's prose poetry is a very small portion of his work, and it
      is not in this way only that he excels. Mr. Saintsbury has spoken of the
      strong appeal that De Quincey makes to boys. [Footnote: "Probably more
      boys have in the last forty years been brought to a love of literature
      proper by De Quincy than by any other writer whatever."&mdash;<i>History
      of Nineteenth-Century Literature</i>, p.198.] It is not without
      significance that he mentions as especially attractive to the young only
      writings with a large narrative element. [Footnote: "To read the <i>Essay
      on Murder</i>, the <i>English Mail-Coach</i>, <i>The Spanish Nun</i>, <i>The
      Cæsars</i>, and half a score other things at the age of about fifteen or
      sixteen is, or ought to be, to fall in love with them."&mdash;<i>Essays in
      English Literature</i>, 1780-1860, p.307.] Few boys read poetry, whether
      in verse or prose, and fewer still criticism or philosophy; to every
      normal boy the gate of good literature is the good story. It is the
      narrative skill of De Quincey that has secured for him, in preference to
      other writers of his class, the favor of youthful readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be too much to say that the talent that attracts the young to him
      must needs be the Opium-Eater's grand talent, though the notion is
      defensible, seeing that only salient qualities in good writing appeal to
      inexperienced readers. I believe, however, that this skill in narration is
      De Quincey's most persistent quality,&mdash;the golden thread that unites
      all his most distinguished and most enduring work. And it is with him a
      part of his genius for style. Creative power of the kind that goes to the
      making of plots De Quincey had not; he has proved that forever by the
      mediocrity of <i>Klosterheim</i>. Give him Bergmann's account of the
      Tartar Migration, or the story of the Fighting Nun,&mdash;give him the
      matter,&mdash;and a brilliant narrative will result. Indeed, De Quincey
      loved a story for its own sake; he rejoiced to see it extend its winding
      course before him; he delighted to follow it, touch it, color it, see it
      grow into body and being under his hand. That this enthusiasm should now
      and then tend to endanger the integrity of the facts need not surprise us;
      as I have said elsewhere, accuracy in these matters is hardly to be
      expected of De Quincey. And we can take our pleasure in the skillful
      unfolding of the dramatic narrative of the Tartar Flight&mdash;we can feel
      the author's joy in the scenic possibilities of his theme&mdash;even if we
      know that here and there an incident appears that is quite in its proper
      place&mdash;but is unknown to history.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his <i>Confessions</i> the same constructive power bears its part in
      the author's triumph. A peculiar end was to be reached in that narrative,&mdash;an
      end in which the writer had a deep personal interest. What is an
      opium-eater? Says a character in a recent work of fiction, of a social
      wreck: "If it isn't whisky with him, it's opium; if it isn't opium, it's
      whisky." This speech establishes the popular category in which De
      Quincey's habit had placed him. Our attention was to be drawn from these
      degrading connections. And this is done not merely by the correction of
      some widespread fallacies as to the effects of the drug; far more it is
      the result of narrative skill. As we follow with ever-increasing sympathy
      the lonely and sensitive child, the wandering youth, the neuralgic
      patient, into the terrible grasp of opium, who realizes, amid the gorgeous
      delights and the awful horrors of the tale, that the writer is after all
      the victim of the worst of bad habits? We can hardly praise too highly the
      art which even as we look beneath it throws its glamour over us still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is it only in this constructive power, in the selection and
      arrangement of details, that De Quincey excels as a narrator; a score of
      minor excellences of his style, such as the fine Latin words or the
      sweeping periodic sentences, contribute to the effective progress of his
      narrative prose. Mr. Lowell has said that "there are no such vistas and
      avenues of verse as Milton's." The comparison is somewhat hazardous, still
      I should like to venture the parallel claim that there are no such streams
      of prose as De Quincey's. The movement of his discourse is that of the
      broad river, not in its weight or force perhaps, but in its easy flowing
      progress, in its serene, unhurried certainty of its end. To be sure, only
      too often the waters overflow their banks and run far afield in alien
      channels. Yet, when great power over the instrument of language is joined
      to so much constructive skill, the result is narrative art of high
      quality,&mdash;an achievement that must be in no small measure the solid
      basis of De Quincey's fame.

    <h2>
      SECTION I&mdash;THE GLORY OF MOTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some twenty or more years before I matriculated at Oxford, Mr. Palmer, at
      that time M.P. for Bath, had accomplished two things, very hard to do on
      our little planet, the Earth, however cheap they may be held by eccentric
      people in comets: he had invented mail-coaches, and he had married the
      daughter of a duke. He was, therefore, just twice as great a man as
      Galileo, who did certainly invent (or, which is the same thing, [Footnote:
      "<i>The same thing</i>":&mdash;Thus, in the calendar of the Church
      Festivals, the discovery of the true cross (by Helen, the mother of
      Constantine) is recorded (and, one might think, with the express
      consciousness of sarcasm) as the <i>Invention</i> of the Cross.] discover)
      the satellites of Jupiter, those very next things extant to mail-coaches
      in the two capital pretensions of speed and keeping time, but, on the
      other hand, who did <i>not</i> marry the daughter of a duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      These mail-coaches, as organised by Mr. Palmer, are entitled to a
      circumstantial notice from myself, having had so large a share in
      developing the anarchies of my subsequent dreams: an agency which they
      accomplished, 1st, through velocity at that time unprecedented&mdash;for
      they first revealed the glory of motion; 2dly, through grand effects for
      the eye between lamplight and the darkness upon solitary roads; 3dly,
      through animal beauty and power so often displayed in the class of horses
      selected for this mail service; 4thly, through the conscious presence of a
      central intellect, that, in the midst of vast distances [Footnote: "Vast
      distances":&mdash;One case was familiar to mail-coach travellers where two
      mails in opposite directions, north and south, starting at the same minute
      from points six hundred miles apart, met almost constantly at a particular
      bridge which bisected the total distance.]&mdash;of storms, of darkness,
      of danger&mdash;overruled all obstacles into one steady co-operation to a
      national result. For my own feeling, this post-office service spoke as by
      some mighty orchestra, where a thousand instruments, all disregarding each
      other, and so far in danger of discord, yet all obedient as slaves to the
      supreme <i>baton</i> of some great leader, terminate in a perfection of
      harmony like that of heart, brain, and lungs in a healthy animal
      organisation. But, finally, that particular element in this whole
      combination which most impressed myself, and through which it is that to
      this hour Mr. Palmer's mail-coach system tyrannises over my dreams by
      terror and terrific beauty, lay in the awful <i>political</i> mission
      which at that time it fulfilled. The mail-coach it was that distributed
      over the face of the land, like the opening of apocalyptic vials, the
      heart-shaking news of Trafalgar, of Salamanca, of Vittoria, of Waterloo.
      These were the harvests that, in the grandeur of their reaping, redeemed
      the tears and blood in which they had been sown. Neither was the meanest
      peasant so much below the grandeur and the sorrow of the times as to
      confound battles such as these, which were gradually moulding the
      destinies of Christendom, with the vulgar conflicts of ordinary warfare,
      so often no more than gladiatorial trials of national prowess. The
      victories of England in this stupendous contest rose of themselves as
      natural <i>Te Deums</i> to heaven; and it was felt by the thoughtful that
      such victories, at such a crisis of general prostration, were not more
      beneficial to ourselves than finally to France, our enemy, and to the
      nations of all western or central Europe, through whose pusillanimity it
      was that the French domination had prospered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mail-coach, as the national organ for publishing these mighty events,
      thus diffusively influential, became itself a spiritualised and glorified
      object to an impassioned heart; and naturally, in the Oxford of that day,
      <i>all</i> hearts were impassioned, as being all (or nearly all) in <i>early</i>
      manhood. In most universities there is one single college; in Oxford there
      were five-and-twenty, all of which were peopled by young men, the <i>élite</i>
      of their own generation; not boys, but men: none under eighteen. In some
      of these many colleges the custom permitted the student to keep what are
      called "short terms"; that is, the four terms of Michaelmas, Lent, Easter,
      and Act, were kept by a residence, in the aggregate, of ninety-one days,
      or thirteen weeks. Under this interrupted residence, it was possible that
      a student might have a reason for going down to his home four times in the
      year. This made eight journeys to and fro. But, as these homes lay
      dispersed through all the shires of the island, and most of us disdained
      all coaches except his Majesty's mail, no city out of London could pretend
      to so extensive a connexion with Mr. Palmer's establishment as Oxford.
      Three mails, at the least, I remember as passing every day through Oxford,
      and benefiting by my personal patronage&mdash;viz., the Worcester, the
      Gloucester, and the Holyhead mail. Naturally, therefore, it became a point
      of some interest with us, whose journeys revolved every six weeks on an
      average, to look a little into the executive details of the system. With
      some of these Mr. Palmer had no concern; they rested upon bye-laws enacted
      by posting-houses for their own benefit, and upon other bye-laws, equally
      stern, enacted by the inside passengers for the illustration of their own
      haughty exclusiveness. These last were of a nature to rouse our scorn;
      from which the transition was not very long to systematic mutiny. Up to
      this time, say 1804, or 1805 (the year of Trafalgar), it had been the
      fixed assumption of the four inside people (as an old tradition of all
      public carriages derived from the reign of Charles II) that they, the
      illustrious quaternion, constituted a porcelain variety of the human race,
      whose dignity would have been compromised by exchanging one word of
      civility with the three miserable delf-ware outsides. Even to have kicked
      an outsider might have been held to attaint the foot concerned in that
      operation, so that, perhaps, it would have required an act of Parliament
      to restore its purity of blood. What words, then, could express the
      horror, and the sense of treason, in that case, which <i>had</i> happened,
      where all three outsides (the trinity of Pariahs) made a vain attempt to
      sit down at the same breakfast-table or dinner-table with the consecrated
      four? I myself witnessed such an attempt; and on that occasion a
      benevolent old gentleman endeavoured to soothe his three holy associates,
      by suggesting that, if the outsides were indicted for this criminal
      attempt at the next assizes, the court would regard it as a case of lunacy
      or <i>delirium tremens</i> rather than of treason. England owes much of
      her grandeur to the depth of the aristocratic element in her social
      composition, when pulling against her strong democracy. I am not the man
      to laugh at it. But sometimes, undoubtedly, it expressed itself in comic
      shapes. The course taken with the infatuated outsiders, in the particular
      attempt which I have noticed, was that the waiter, beckoning them away
      from the privileged <i>salle-à-manger</i>, sang out, "This way, my good
      men," and then enticed these good men away to the kitchen. But that plan
      had not always answered. Sometimes, though rarely, cases occurred where
      the intruders, being stronger than usual, or more vicious than usual,
      resolutely refused to budge, and so far carried their point as to have a
      separate table arranged for themselves in a corner of the general room.
      Yet, if an Indian screen could be found ample enough to plant them out
      from the very eyes of the high table, or <i>dais</i>, it then became
      possible to assume as a fiction of law that the three delf fellows, after
      all, were not present. They could be ignored by the porcelain men, under
      the maxim that objects not appearing and objects not existing are governed
      by the same logical construction. [Footnote: <i>De non apparentibus</i>,
      etc.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Such being, at that time, the usage of mail-coaches, what was to be done
      by us of young Oxford? We, the most aristocratic of people, who were
      addicted to the practice of looking down superciliously even upon the
      insides themselves as often very questionable characters&mdash;were we, by
      voluntarily going outside, to court indignities? If our dress and bearing
      sheltered us generally from the suspicion of being "raff" (the name at
      that period for "snobs" [Footnote: "<i>Snobs</i>," and its antithesis, "<i>nobs</i>,"
      arose among the internal factions of shoemakers perhaps ten years later.
      Possibly enough, the terms may have existed much earlier; but they were
      then first made known, picturesquely and effectively, by a trial at some
      assizes which happened to fix the public attention.]), we really <i>were</i>
      such constructively by the place we assumed. If we did not submit to the
      deep shadow of eclipse, we entered at least the skirts of its penumbra.
      And the analogy of theatres was valid against us,&mdash;where no man can
      complain of the annoyances incident to the pit or gallery, having his
      instant remedy in paying the higher price of the boxes. But the soundness
      of this analogy we disputed. In the case of the theatre, it cannot be
      pretended that the inferior situations have any separate attractions,
      unless the pit may be supposed to have an advantage for the purposes of
      the critic or the dramatic reporter. But the critic or reporter is a
      rarity. For most people, the sole benefit is in the price. Now, on the
      contrary, the outside of the mail had its own incommunicable advantages.
      These we could not forego. The higher price we would willingly have paid,
      but not the price connected with the condition of riding inside; which
      condition we pronounced insufferable. The air, the freedom of prospect,
      the proximity to the horses, the elevation of seat: these were what we
      required; but, above all, the certain anticipation of purchasing
      occasional opportunities of driving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the difficulty which pressed us; and under the coercion of this
      difficulty we instituted a searching inquiry into the true quality and
      valuation of the different apartments about the mail. We conducted this
      inquiry on metaphysical principles; and it was ascertained satisfactorily
      that the roof of the coach, which by some weak men had been called the
      attics, and by some the garrets, was in reality the drawing-room; in which
      drawing-room the box was the chief ottoman or sofa; whilst it appeared
      that the <i>inside</i> which had been traditionally regarded as the only
      room tenantable by gentlemen, was, in fact, the coal-cellar in disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great wits jump. The very same idea had not long before struck the
      celestial intellect of China. Amongst the presents carried out by our
      first embassy to that country was a state-coach. It had been specially
      selected as a personal gift by George III; but the exact mode of using it
      was an intense mystery to Pekin. The ambassador, indeed (Lord Macartney),
      had made some imperfect explanations upon this point; but, as His
      Excellency communicated these in a diplomatic whisper at the very moment
      of his departure, the celestial intellect was very feebly illuminated, and
      it became necessary to call a cabinet council on the grand state question,
      "Where was the Emperor to sit?" The hammer-cloth happened to be unusually
      gorgeous; and, partly on that consideration, but partly also because the
      box offered the most elevated seat, was nearest to the moon, and
      undeniably went foremost, it was resolved by acclamation that the box was
      the imperial throne, and, for the scoundrel who drove,&mdash;he might sit
      where he could find a perch. The horses, therefore, being harnessed,
      solemnly his imperial majesty ascended his new English throne under a
      flourish of trumpets, having the first lord of the treasury on his right
      hand, and the chief jester on his left. Pekin gloried in the spectacle;
      and in the whole flowery people, constructively present by representation,
      there was but one discontented person, and <i>that</i> was the coachman.
      This mutinous individual audaciously shouted, "Where am <i>I</i> to sit?"
      But the privy council, incensed by his disloyalty, unanimously opened the
      door, and kicked him into the inside. He had all the inside places to
      himself; but such is the rapacity of ambition that he was still
      dissatisfied. "I say," he cried out in an extempore petition addressed to
      the Emperor through the window&mdash;"I say, how am I to catch hold of the
      reins?"&mdash;"Anyhow," was the imperial answer; "don't trouble <i>me</i>,
      man, in my glory. How catch the reins? Why, through the windows, through
      the keyholes&mdash;<i>anyhow</i>." Finally this contumacious coachman
      lengthened the check-strings into a sort of jury-reins communicating with
      the horses; with these he drove as steadily as Pekin had any right to
      expect. The Emperor returned after the briefest of circuits; he descended
      in great pomp from his throne, with the severest resolution never to
      remount it. A public thanksgiving was ordered for his majesty's happy
      escape from the disease of a broken neck; and the state-coach was
      dedicated thenceforward as a votive offering to the god Fo Fo&mdash;whom
      the learned more accurately called Fi Fi.
    </p>
    <p>
      A revolution of this same Chinese character did young Oxford of that era
      effect in the constitution of mail-coach society. It was a perfect French
      Revolution; and we had good reason to say, <i>ça ira</i>. In fact, it soon
      became <i>too</i> popular. The "public"&mdash;a well-known character,
      particularly disagreeable, though slightly respectable, and notorious for
      affecting the chief seats in synagogues&mdash;had at first loudly opposed
      this revolution; but, when the opposition showed itself to be ineffectual,
      our disagreeable friend went into it with headlong zeal. At first it was a
      sort of race between us; and, as the public is usually from thirty to
      fifty years old, naturally we of young Oxford, that averaged about twenty,
      had the advantage. Then the public took to bribing, giving fees to
      horse-keepers, &amp;c., who hired out their persons as warming-pans on the
      box seat. <i>That</i>, you know, was shocking to all moral sensibilities.
      Come to bribery, said we, and there is an end to all morality,&mdash;Aristotle's,
      Zeno's, Cicero's, or anybody's. And, besides, of what use was it? For <i>we</i>
      bribed also. And, as our bribes, to those of the public, were as five
      shillings to sixpence, here again young Oxford had the advantage. But the
      contest was ruinous to the principles of the stables connected with the
      mails. This whole corporation was constantly bribed, rebribed, and often
      surrebribed; a mail-coach yard was like the hustings in a contested
      election; and a horse-keeper, ostler, or helper, was held by the
      philosophical at that time to be the most corrupt character in the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an impression upon the public mind, natural enough from the
      continually augmenting velocity of the mail, but quite erroneous, that an
      outside seat on this class of carriages was a post of danger. On the
      contrary, I maintained that, if a man had become nervous from some gipsy
      prediction in his childhood, allocating to a particular moon now
      approaching some unknown danger, and he should inquire earnestly, "Whither
      can I fly for shelter? Is a prison the safest retreat? or a lunatic
      hospital? or the British Museum?" I should have replied, "Oh no; I'll tell
      you what to do. Take lodgings for the next forty days on the box of his
      Majesty's mail. Nobody can touch you there. If it is by bills at ninety
      days after date that you are made unhappy&mdash;if noters and protesters
      are the sort of wretches whose astrological shadows darken the house of
      life&mdash;then note you what I vehemently protest: viz., that, no matter
      though the sheriff and under-sheriff in every county should be running
      after you with his <i>posse</i>, touch a hair of your head he cannot
      whilst you keep house and have your legal domicile on the box of the mail.
      It is felony to stop the mail; even the sheriff cannot do that. And an <i>extra</i>
      touch of the whip to the leaders (no great matter if it grazes the
      sheriff) at any time guarantees your safety." In fact, a bedroom in a
      quiet house seems a safe enough retreat; yet it is liable to its own
      notorious nuisances&mdash;to robbers by night, to rats, to fire. But the
      mail laughs at these terrors. To robbers, the answer is packed up and
      ready for delivery in the barrel of the guard's blunderbuss. Rats again!
      there <i>are</i> none about mail-coaches any more than snakes in Von
      Troil's Iceland; [Footnote: "<i>Von Troil's Iceland</i>":&mdash;The
      allusion is to a well-known chapter in Von Troil's work, entitled,
      "Concerning the Snakes of Iceland." The entire chapter consists of these
      six words&mdash;"<i>There art no snakes in Iceland</i>."] except, indeed,
      now and then a parliamentary rat, who always hides his shame in what I
      have shown to be the "coal-cellar." And, as to fire, I never knew but one
      in a mail-coach; which was in the Exeter mail, and caused by an obstinate
      sailor bound to Devonport. Jack, making light of the law and the lawgiver
      that had set their faces against his offence, insisted on taking up a
      forbidden seat [Footnote: "<i>Forbidden seat</i>":&mdash;The very sternest
      code of rules was enforced upon the mails by the Post-office. Throughout
      England, only three outsides were allowed, of whom one was to sit on the
      box, and the other two immediately behind the box; none, under any
      pretext, to come near the guard; an indispensable caution; since else,
      under the guise of a passenger, a robber might by any one of a thousand
      advantages&mdash;which sometimes are created, but always are favoured, by
      the animation of frank social intercourse&mdash;have disarmed the guard.
      Beyond the Scottish border, the regulation was so far relaxed as to allow
      of <i>four</i> outsides, but not relaxed at all as to the mode of placing
      them. One, as before, was seated on the box, and the other three on the
      front of the roof, with a determinate and ample separation from the little
      insulated chair of the guard. This relaxation was conceded by way of
      compensating to Scotland her disadvantages in point of population.
      England, by the superior density of her population, might always count
      upon a large fund of profits in the fractional trips of chance passengers
      riding for short distances of two or three stages. In Scotland this chance
      counted for much less. And therefore, to make good the deficiency,
      Scotland was allowed a compensatory profit upon one <i>extra</i>
      passenger.] in the rear of the roof, from which he could exchange his own
      yarns with those of the guard. No greater offence was then known to
      mail-coaches; it was treason, it was <i>læsa majestas</i>, it was by
      tendency arson; and the ashes of Jack's pipe, falling amongst the straw of
      the hinder boot, containing the mail-bags, raised a flame which (aided by
      the wind of our motion) threatened a revolution in the republic of
      letters. Yet even this left the sanctity of the box unviolated. In
      dignified repose, the coachman and myself sat on, resting with benign
      composure upon our knowledge that the fire would have to burn its way
      through four inside passengers before it could reach ourselves. I remarked
      to the coachman, with a quotation from Virgil's "Æneid" really too
      hackneyed&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Jam proximus ardet
  Ucalegon."
</pre>
    <p>
      But, recollecting that the Virgilian part of the coachman's education
      might have been neglected, I interpreted so far as to say that perhaps at
      that moment the flames were catching hold of our worthy brother and inside
      passenger, Ucalegon. The coachman made no answer,&mdash;which is my own
      way when a stranger addresses me either in Syriac or in Coptic; but by his
      faint sceptical smile he seemed to insinuate that he knew better,&mdash;for
      that Ucalegon, as it happened, was not in the way-bill, and therefore
      could not have been booked.

      No dignity is perfect which does not at some point ally itself with the
      mysterious. The connexion of the mail with the state and the executive
      government&mdash;a connexion obvious, but yet not strictly defined&mdash;gave
      to the whole mail establishment an official grandeur which did us service
      on the roads, and invested us with seasonable terrors. Not the less
      impressive were those terrors because their legal limits were imperfectly
      ascertained. Look at those turnpike gates: with what deferential hurry,
      with what an obedient start, they fly open at our approach! Look at that
      long line of carts and carters ahead, audaciously usurping the very crest
      of the road. Ah! traitors, they do not hear us as yet; but, as soon as the
      dreadful blast of our horn reaches them with proclamation of our approach,
      see with what frenzy of trepidation they fly to their horses' heads, and
      deprecate our wrath by the precipitation of their crane-neck quarterings.
      Treason they feel to be their crime; each individual carter feels himself
      under the ban of confiscation and attainder; his blood is attainted
      through six generations; and nothing is wanting but the headsman and his
      axe, the block and the sawdust, to close up the vista of his horrors.
      What! shall it be within benefit of clergy to delay the king's message on
      the high road?&mdash;to interrupt the great respirations, ebb and flood,
      <i>systole</i> and <i>diastole</i>, of the national intercourse?&mdash;to
      endanger the safety of tidings running day and night between all nations
      and languages? Or can it be fancied, amongst the weakest of men, that the
      bodies of the criminals will be given up to their widows for Christian
      burial? Now, the doubts which were raised as to our powers did more to
      wrap them in terror, by wrapping them in uncertainty, than could have been
      effected by the sharpest definitions of the law from the Quarter Sessions.
      We, on our parts (we, the collective mail, I mean), did our utmost to
      exalt the idea of our privileges by the insolence with which we wielded
      them. Whether this insolence rested upon law that gave it a sanction, or
      upon conscious power that haughtily dispensed with that sanction, equally
      it spoke from a potential station; and the agent, in each particular
      insolence of the moment, was viewed reverentially, as one having
      authority.

      Sometimes after breakfast his Majesty's mail would become frisky; and, in
      its difficult wheelings amongst the intricacies of early markets, it would
      upset an apple-cart, a cart loaded with eggs, &amp;c. Huge was the
      affliction and dismay, awful was the smash. I, as far as possible,
      endeavoured in such a case to represent the conscience and moral
      sensibilities of the mail; and, when wildernesses of eggs were lying
      poached under our horses' hoofs, then would I stretch forth my hands in
      sorrow, saying (in words too celebrated at that time, from the false
      echoes [Footnote: "<i>False echoes</i>":&mdash;Yes, false! for the words
      ascribed to Napoleon, as breathed to the memory of Desaix, never were
      uttered at all. They stand in the same category of theatrical fictions as
      the cry of the foundering line-of-battle ship <i>Vengeur</i>, as the vaunt
      of General Cambronne at Waterloo, "La Garde meurt, mais ne se rend pas,"
      or as the repartees of Talleyrand.] of Marengo), "Ah! wherefore have we
      not time to weep over you?"&mdash;which was evidently impossible, since,
      in fact, we had not time to laugh over them. Tied to post-office allowance
      in some cases of fifty minutes for eleven miles, could the royal mail
      pretend to undertake the offices of sympathy and condolence? Could it be
      expected to provide tears for the accidents of the road? If even it seemed
      to trample on humanity, it did so, I felt, in discharge of its own more
      peremptory duties.

    <p>
      Upholding the morality of the mail, <i>a fortiori</i> I upheld its rights;
      as a matter of duty, I stretched to the uttermost its privilege of
      imperial precedency, and astonished weak minds by the feudal powers which
      I hinted to be lurking constructively in the charters of this proud
      establishment. Once I remember being on the box of the Holyhead mail,
      between Shrewsbury and Oswestry, when a tawdry thing from Birmingham, some
      "Tallyho" or "Highflyer," all flaunting with green and gold, came up
      alongside of us. What a contrast to our royal simplicity of form and
      colour in this plebeian wretch! The single ornament on our dark ground of
      chocolate colour was the mighty shield of the imperial arms, but
      emblazoned in proportions as modest as a signet-ring bears to a seal of
      office. Even this was displayed only on a single panel, whispering, rather
      than proclaiming, our relations to the mighty state; whilst the beast from
      Birmingham, our green-and-gold friend from false, fleeting, perjured
      Brummagem, had as much writing and painting on its sprawling flanks as
      would have puzzled a decipherer from the tombs of Luxor. For some time
      this Birmingham machine ran along by our side&mdash;a piece of familiarity
      that already of itself seemed to me sufficiently Jacobinical. But all at
      once a movement of the horses announced a desperate intention of leaving
      us behind. "Do you see <i>that?</i>" I said to the coachman.&mdash;"I
      see," was his short answer. He was wide awake,&mdash;yet he waited longer
      than seemed prudent; for the horses of our audacious opponent had a
      disagreeable air of freshness and power. But his motive was loyal; his
      wish was that the Birmingham conceit should be full-blown before he froze
      it. When <i>that</i> seemed right, he unloosed, or, to speak by a stronger
      word, he <i>sprang</i>, his known resources: he slipped our royal horses
      like cheetahs, or hunting-leopards, after the affrighted game. How they
      could retain such a reserve of fiery power after the work they had
      accomplished seemed hard to explain. But on our side, besides the physical
      superiority, was a tower of moral strength, namely the king's name, "which
      they upon the adverse faction wanted." Passing them without an effort, as
      it seemed, we threw them into the rear with so lengthening an interval
      between us as proved in itself the bitterest mockery of their presumption;
      whilst our guard blew back a shattering blast of triumph that was really
      too painfully full of derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mention this little incident for its connexion with what followed. A
      Welsh rustic, sitting behind me, asked if I had not felt my heart burn
      within me during the progress of the race? I said, with philosophic
      calmness, <i>No</i>; because we were not racing with a mail, so that no
      glory could be gained. In fact, it was sufficiently mortifying that such a
      Birmingham thing should dare to challenge us. The Welshman replied that he
      didn't see <i>that</i>; for that a cat might look at a king, and a
      Brummagem coach might lawfully race the Holyhead mail. "<i>Race</i> us, if
      you like," I replied, "though even <i>that</i> has an air of sedition; but
      not <i>beat</i> us. This would have been treason; and for its own sake I
      am glad that the 'Tallyho' was disappointed." So dissatisfied did the
      Welshman seem with this opinion that at last I was obliged to tell him a
      very fine story from one of our elder dramatists: viz., that once, in some
      far Oriental kingdom, when the sultan of all the land, with his princes,
      ladies, and chief omrahs, were flying their falcons, a hawk suddenly flew
      at a majestic eagle, and, in defiance of the eagle's natural advantages,
      in contempt also of the eagle's traditional royalty, and before the whole
      assembled field of astonished spectators from Agra and Lahore, killed the
      eagle on the spot. Amazement seized the sultan at the unequal contest, and
      burning admiration for its unparalleled result. He commanded that the hawk
      should be brought before him; he caressed the bird with enthusiasm; and he
      ordered that, for the commemoration of his matchless courage, a diadem of
      gold and rubies should be solemnly placed on the hawk's head, but then
      that, immediately after this solemn coronation, the bird should be led off
      to execution, as the most valiant indeed of traitors, but not the less a
      traitor, as having dared to rise rebelliously against his liege lord and
      anointed sovereign, the eagle. "Now," said I to the Welshman, "to you and
      me, as men of refined sensibilities, how painful it would have been that
      this poor Brummagem brute, the 'Tallyho,' in the impossible case of a
      victory over us, should have been crowned with Birmingham tinsel, with
      paste diamonds and Roman pearls, and then led off to instant execution."
      The Welshman doubted if that could be warranted by law. And, when I hinted
      at the 6th of Edward Longshanks, chap. 18, for regulating the precedency
      of coaches, as being probably the statute relied on for the capital
      punishment of such offences, he replied drily that, if the attempt to pass
      a mail really were treasonable, it was a pity that the "Tallyho" appeared
      to have so imperfect an acquaintance with law.

      The modern modes of travelling cannot compare with the old mail-coach
      system in grandeur and power. They boast of more velocity,&mdash;not,
      however, as a consciousness, but as a fact of our lifeless knowledge,
      resting upon <i>alien</i> evidence: as, for instance, because somebody <i>says</i>
      that we have gone fifty miles in the hour, though we are far from feeling
      it as a personal experience; or upon the evidence of a result, as that
      actually we find ourselves in York four hours after leaving London. Apart
      from such an assertion, or such a result, I myself am little aware of the
      pace. But, seated on the old mail-coach, we needed no evidence out of
      ourselves to indicate the velocity. On this system the word was not <i>magna
      loquimur</i>, as upon railways, but <i>vivimus</i>. Yes, "magna <i>vivimus</i>";
      we do not make verbal ostentation of our grandeurs, we realise our
      grandeurs in act, and in the very experience of life. The vital experience
      of the glad animal sensibilities made doubts impossible on the question of
      our speed; we heard our speed, we saw it, we felt it as a thrilling; and
      this speed was not the product of blind insensate agencies, that had no
      sympathy to give, but was incarnated in the fiery eyeballs of the noblest
      amongst brutes, in his dilated nostril, spasmodic muscles, and
      thunder-beating hoofs. The sensibility of the horse, uttering itself in
      the maniac light of his eye, might be the last vibration of such a
      movement; the glory of Salamanca might be the first. But the intervening
      links that connected them, that spread the earthquake of battle into the
      eyeballs of the horse, were the heart of man and its electric thrillings&mdash;kindling
      in the rapture of the fiery strife, and then propagating its own tumults
      by contagious shouts and gestures to the heart of his servant the horse.
      But now, on the new system of travelling, iron tubes and boilers have
      disconnected man's heart from the ministers of his locomotion. Nile nor
      Trafalgar has power to raise an extra bubble in a steam-kettle. The
      galvanic cycle is broken up for ever; man's imperial nature no longer
      sends itself forward through the electric sensibility of the horse; the
      inter-agencies are gone in the mode of communication between the horse and
      his master out of which grew so many aspects of sublimity under accidents
      of mists that hid, or sudden blazes that revealed, of mobs that agitated,
      or midnight solitudes that awed. Tidings fitted to convulse all nations
      must henceforwards travel by culinary process; and the trumpet that once
      announced from afar the laurelled mail, heart-shaking when heard screaming
      on the wind and proclaiming itself through the darkness to every village
      or solitary house on its route, has now given way for ever to the
      pot-wallopings of the boiler. Thus have perished multiform openings for
      public expressions of interest, scenical yet natural, in great national
      tidings,&mdash;for revelations of faces and groups that could not offer
      themselves amongst the fluctuating mobs of a railway station. The
      gatherings of gazers about a laurelled mail had one centre, and
      acknowledged one sole interest. But the crowds attending at a railway
      station have as little unity as running water, and own as many centres as
      there are separate carriages in the train.

      How else, for example, than as a constant watcher for the dawn, and for
      the London mail that in summer months entered about daybreak amongst the
      lawny thickets of Maryborough forest, couldst thou, sweet Fanny of the
      Bath road, have become the glorified inmate of my dreams? Yet Fanny, as
      the loveliest young woman for face and person that perhaps in my whole
      life I have beheld, merited the station which even now, from a distance of
      forty years, she holds in my dreams; yes, though by links of natural
      association she brings along with her a troop of dreadful creatures,
      fabulous and not fabulous, that are more abominable to the heart than
      Fanny and the dawn are delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Fanny of the Bath road, strictly speaking, lived at a mile's distance
      from that road, but came so continually to meet the mail that I on my
      frequent transits rarely missed her, and naturally connected her image
      with the great thoroughfare where only I had ever seen her. Why she came
      so punctually I do not exactly know; but I believe with some burden of
      commissions, to be executed in Bath, which had gathered to her own
      residence as a central rendezvous for converging them. The mail-coachman
      who drove the Bath mail and wore the royal livery [Footnote: "Wore the
      royal livery":&mdash;The general impression was that the royal livery
      belonged of right to the mail-coachmen as their professional dress. But
      that was an error. To the guard it <i>did</i> belong, I believe, and was
      obviously essential as an official warrant, and as a means of instant
      identification for his person, in the discharge of his important public
      duties. But the coachman, and especially if his place in the series did
      not connect him immediately with London and the General Post-Office,
      obtained the scarlet coat only as an honorary distinction after long (or,
      if not long, trying and special) service.] happened to be Fanny's
      grandfather. A good man he was, that loved his beautiful granddaughter,
      and, loving her wisely, was vigilant over her deportment in any case where
      young Oxford might happen to be concerned. Did my vanity then suggest that
      I myself, individually, could fall within the line of his terrors?
      Certainly not, as regarded any physical pretensions that I could plead;
      for Fanny (as a chance passenger from her own neighbourhood once told me)
      counted in her train a hundred and ninety-nine professed admirers, if not
      open aspirants to her favour; and probably not one of the whole brigade
      but excelled myself in personal advantages. Ulysses even, with the unfair
      advantage of his accursed bow, could hardly have undertaken that amount of
      suitors. So the danger might have seemed slight&mdash;only that woman is
      universally aristocratic; it is amongst her nobilities of heart that she
      <i>is</i> so. Now, the aristocratic distinctions in my favour might easily
      with Miss Fanny have compensated my physical deficiencies. Did I then make
      love to Fanny? Why, yes; about as much love as one <i>could</i> make
      whilst the mail was changing horses&mdash;a process which, ten years
      later, did not occupy above eighty seconds; but <i>then</i>,&mdash;viz.,
      about Waterloo&mdash;it occupied five times eighty. Now, four hundred
      seconds offer a field quite ample enough for whispering into a young
      woman's ear a great deal of truth, and (by way of parenthesis) some trifle
      of falsehood. Grandpapa did right, therefore, to watch me. And yet, as
      happens too often to the grandpapas of earth in a contest with the
      admirers of granddaughters, how vainly would he have watched me had I
      meditated any evil whispers to Fanny! She, it is my belief, would have
      protected herself against any man's evil suggestions. But he, as the
      result showed, could not have intercepted the opportunities for such
      suggestions. Yet, why not? Was he not active? Was he not blooming?
      Blooming he was as Fanny herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, all our praises why should lords&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stop, that's not the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, all our roses why should girls engross?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman showed rosy blossoms on his face deeper even than his
      granddaughter's&mdash;<i>his</i> being drawn from the ale-cask, Fanny's
      from the fountains of the dawn. But, in spite of his blooming face, some
      infirmities he had; and one particularly in which he too much resembled a
      crocodile. This lay in a monstrous inaptitude for turning round. The
      crocodile, I presume, owes that inaptitude to the absurd <i>length</i> of
      his back; but in our grandpapa it arose rather from the absurd <i>breadth</i>
      of his back, combined, possibly, with some growing stiffness in his legs.
      Now, upon this crocodile infirmity of his I planted a human advantage for
      tendering my homage to Miss Fanny. In defiance of all his honourable
      vigilance, no sooner had he presented to us his mighty Jovian back (what a
      field for displaying to mankind his royal scarlet!), whilst inspecting
      professionally the buckles, the straps, and the silvery turrets [Footnote:
      "<i>Turrets</i>":&mdash;As one who loves and venerates Chaucer for his
      unrivalled merits of tenderness, of picturesque characterisation, and of
      narrative skill, I noticed with great pleasure that the word <i>torrettes</i>
      is used by him to designate the little devices through which the reins are
      made to pass. This same word, in the same exact sense, I heard uniformly
      used by many scores of illustrious mail-coachmen to whose confidential
      friendship I had the honour of being admitted in my younger days.] of his
      harness, than I raised Miss Fanny's hand to my lips, and, by the mixed
      tenderness and respectfulness of my manner, caused her easily to
      understand how happy it would make me to rank upon her list as No. 10 or
      12: in which case a few casualties amongst her lovers (and, observe, they
      <i>hanged</i> liberally in those days) might have promoted me speedily to
      the top of the tree; as, on the other hand, with how much loyalty of
      submission I acquiesced by anticipation in her award, supposing that she
      should plant me in the very rearward of her favour, as No. 199 + 1. Most
      truly I loved this beautiful and ingenuous girl; and, had it not been for
      the Bath mail, timing all courtships by post-office allowance, heaven only
      knows what might have come of it. People talk of being over head and ears
      in love; now, the mail was the cause that I sank only over ears in love,&mdash;which,
      you know, still left a trifle of brain to overlook the whole conduct of
      the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, reader! when I look back upon those days, it seems to me that all
      things change&mdash;all things perish. "Perish the roses and the palms of
      kings": perish even the crowns and trophies of Waterloo: thunder and
      lightning are not the thunder and lightning which I remember. Roses are
      degenerating. The Fannies of our island&mdash;though this I say with
      reluctance&mdash;are not visibly improving; and the Bath road is
      notoriously superannuated. Crocodiles, you will say, are stationary. Mr.
      Waterton tells me that the crocodile does <i>not change</i>,&mdash;that a
      cayman, in fact, or an alligator, is just as good for riding upon as he
      was in the time of the Pharaohs. <i>That</i> may be; but the reason is
      that the crocodile does not live fast&mdash;he is a slow coach. I believe
      it is generally understood among naturalists that the crocodile is a
      blockhead. It is my own impression that the Pharaohs were also blockheads.
      Now, as the Pharaohs and the crocodile domineered over Egyptian society,
      this accounts for a singular mistake that prevailed through innumerable
      generations on the Nile. The crocodile made the ridiculous blunder of
      supposing man to be meant chiefly for his own eating. Man, taking a
      different view of the subject, naturally met that mistake by another: he
      viewed the crocodile as a thing sometimes to worship, but always to run
      away from. And this continued till Mr. Waterton [Footnote: "<i>Mr.
      Waterton</i>":&mdash;Had the reader lived through the last generation, he
      would not need to be told that, some thirty or thirty-five years back, Mr.
      Waterton, a distinguished country gentleman of ancient family in
      Northumberland, publicly mounted and rode in top-boots a savage old
      crocodile, that was restive and very impertinent, but all to no purpose.
      The crocodile jibbed and tried to kick, but vainly. He was no more able to
      throw the squire than Sinbad was to throw the old scoundrel who used his
      back without paying for it, until he discovered a mode (slightly immoral,
      perhaps, though some think not) of murdering the old fraudulent jockey,
      and so circuitously of unhorsing him.] changed the relations between the
      animals. The mode of escaping from the reptile he showed to be not by
      running away, but by leaping on its back booted and spurred. The two
      animals had misunderstood each other. The use of the crocodile has now
      been cleared up&mdash;viz., to be ridden; and the final cause of man is
      that he may improve the health of the crocodile by riding him
      a-fox-hunting before breakfast. And it is pretty certain that any
      crocodile who has been regularly hunted through the season, and is master
      of the weight he carries, will take a six-barred gate now as well as ever
      he would have done in the infancy of the pyramids.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, therefore, the crocodile does <i>not</i> change, all things else
      undeniably <i>do</i>: even the shadow of the pyramids grows less. And
      often the restoration in vision of Fanny and the Bath road makes me too
      pathetically sensible of that truth. Out of the darkness, if I happen to
      call back the image of Fanny, up rises suddenly from a gulf of forty years
      a rose in June; or, if I think for an instant of the rose in June, up
      rises the heavenly face of Fanny. One after the other, like the
      antiphonies in the choral service, rise Fanny and the rose in June, then
      back again the rose in June and Fanny. Then come both together, as in a
      chorus&mdash;roses and Fannies, Fannies and roses, without end, thick as
      blossoms in paradise. Then comes a venerable crocodile, in a royal livery
      of scarlet and gold, with sixteen capes; and the crocodile is driving
      four-in-hand from the box of the Bath mail. And suddenly we upon the mail
      are pulled up by a mighty dial, sculptured with the hours, that mingle
      with the heavens and the heavenly host. Then all at once we are arrived at
      Marlborough forest, amongst the lovely households [Footnote: "<i>Households</i>":&mdash;Roe-deer
      do not congregate in herds like the fallow or the red deer, but by
      separate families, parents and children; which feature of approximation to
      the sanctity of human hearths, added to their comparatively miniature and
      graceful proportions, conciliates to them an interest of peculiar
      tenderness, supposing even that this beautiful creature is less
      characteristically impressed with the grandeurs of savage and forest
      life.] of the roe-deer; the deer and their fawns retire into the dewy
      thickets; the thickets are rich with roses; once again the roses call up
      the sweet countenance of Fanny; and she, being the granddaughter of a
      crocodile, awakens a dreadful host of semi-legendary animals&mdash;griffins,
      dragons, basilisks, sphinxes&mdash;till at length the whole vision of
      fighting images crowds into one towering armorial shield, a vast
      emblazonry of human charities and human loveliness that have perished, but
      quartered heraldically with unutterable and demoniac natures, whilst over
      all rises, as a surmounting crest, one fair female hand, with the
      forefinger pointing, in sweet, sorrowful admonition, upwards to heaven,
      where is sculptured the eternal writing which proclaims the frailty of
      earth and her children.

      service was on those occasions when we went down from London with the news
      of victory. A period of about ten years stretched from Trafalgar to
      Waterloo; the second and third years of which period (1806 and 1807) were
      comparatively sterile; but the other nine (from 1805 to 1815 inclusively)
      furnished a long succession of victories, the least of which, in such a
      contest of Titans, had an inappreciable value of position: partly for its
      absolute interference with the plans of our enemy, but still more from its
      keeping alive through central Europe the sense of a deep-seated
      vulnerability in France. Even to tease the coasts of our enemy, to mortify
      them by continual blockades, to insult them by capturing if it were but a
      baubling schooner under the eyes of their arrogant armies, repeated from
      time to time a sullen proclamation of power lodged in one quarter to which
      the hopes of Christendom turned in secret. How much more loudly must this
      proclamation have spoken in the audacity [Footnote: "<i>Audacity</i>":&mdash;Such
      the French accounted it; and it has struck me that Soult would not have
      been so popular in London, at the period of her present Majesty's
      coronation, or in Manchester, on occasion of his visit to that town, if
      they had been aware of the insolence with which he spoke of us in notes
      written at intervals from the field of Waterloo. As though it had been
      mere felony in our army to look a French one in the face, he said in more
      notes than one, dated from two to four P.M. on the field of Waterloo,
      "Here are the English&mdash;we have them; they are caught <i>en flagrant
      délit</i>" Yet no man should have known us better; no man had drunk deeper
      from the cup of humiliation than Soult had in 1809, when ejected by us
      with headlong violence from Oporto, and pursued through a long line of
      wrecks to the frontier of Spain; and subsequently at Albuera, in the
      bloodiest of recorded battles, to say nothing of Toulouse, he should have
      learned our pretensions.] of having bearded the <i>élite</i> of their
      troops, and having beaten them in pitched battles! Five years of life it
      was worth paying down for the privilege of an outside place on a
      mail-coach, when carrying down the first tidings of any such event. And it
      is to be noted that, from our insular situation, and the multitude of our
      frigates disposable for the rapid transmission of intelligence, rarely did
      any unauthorised rumour steal away a prelibation from the first aroma of
      the regular despatches. The government news was generally the earliest
      news.
    </p>
    <p>
      From eight P.M. to fifteen or twenty minutes later imagine the mails
      assembled on parade in Lombard Street; where, at that time, [Footnote: "<i>At
      that time</i>":&mdash;I speak of the era previous to Waterloo.] and not in
      St. Martin's-le-Grand, was seated the General Post-Office. In what exact
      strength we mustered I do not remember; but, from the length of each
      separate <i>attelage</i>, we filled the street, though a long one, and
      though we were drawn up in double file. On <i>any</i> night the spectacle
      was beautiful. The absolute perfection of all the appointments about the
      carriages and the harness, their strength, their brilliant cleanliness,
      their beautiful simplicity&mdash;but, more than all, the royal
      magnificence of the horses&mdash;were what might first have fixed the
      attention. Every carriage on every morning in the year was taken down to
      an official inspector for examination: wheels, axles, linchpins, pole,
      glasses, lamps, were all critically probed and tested. Every part of every
      carriage had been cleaned, every horse had been groomed, with as much
      rigour as if they belonged to a private gentleman; and that part of the
      spectacle offered itself always. But the night before us is a night of
      victory; and, behold! to the ordinary display what a heart-shaking
      addition!&mdash;horses, men, carriages, all are dressed in laurels and
      flowers, oak-leaves and ribbons. The guards, as being officially his
      Majesty's servants, and of the coachmen such as are within the privilege
      of the post-office, wear the royal liveries of course; and, as it is
      summer (for all the <i>land</i> victories were naturally won in summer),
      they wear, on this fine evening, these liveries exposed to view, without
      any covering of upper coats. Such a costume, and the elaborate arrangement
      of the laurels in their hats, dilate their hearts, by giving to them
      openly a personal connexion with the great news in which already they have
      the general interest of patriotism. That great national sentiment
      surmounts and quells all sense of ordinary distinctions. Those passengers
      who happen to be gentlemen are now hardly to be distinguished as such
      except by dress; for the usual reserve of their manner in speaking to the
      attendants has on this night melted away. One heart, one pride, one glory,
      connects every man by the transcendent bond of his national blood. The
      spectators, who are numerous beyond precedent, express their sympathy with
      these fervent feelings by continual hurrahs. Every moment are shouted
      aloud by the post-office servants, and summoned to draw up, the great
      ancestral names of cities known to history through a thousand years&mdash;Lincoln,
      Winchester, Portsmouth, Gloucester, Oxford, Bristol, Manchester, York,
      Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, Stirling, Aberdeen&mdash;expressing
      the grandeur of the empire by the antiquity of its towns, and the grandeur
      of the mail establishment by the diffusive radiation of its separate
      missions. Every moment you hear the thunder of lids locked down upon the
      mail-bags. That sound to each individual mail is the signal for drawing
      off; which process is the finest part of the entire spectacle. Then come
      the horses into play. Horses! can these be horses that bound off with the
      action and gestures of leopards? What stir!&mdash;what sea-like ferment!&mdash;what
      a thundering of wheels!&mdash;what a trampling of hoofs!&mdash;what a
      sounding of trumpets!&mdash;what farewell cheers&mdash;what redoubling
      peals of brotherly congratulation, connecting the name of the particular
      mail&mdash;"Liverpool for ever!"&mdash;with the name of the particular
      victory&mdash;"Badajoz for ever!" or "Salamanca for ever!" The
      half-slumbering consciousness that all night long, and all the next day&mdash;perhaps
      for even a longer period&mdash;many of these mails, like fire racing along
      a train of gunpowder, will be kindling at every instant new successions of
      burning joy, has an obscure effect of multiplying the victory itself, by
      multiplying to the imagination into infinity the stages of its progressive
      diffusion. A fiery arrow seems to be let loose, which from that moment is
      destined to travel, without intermission, westwards for three hundred
      [Footnote: "<i>Three hundred</i>":&mdash;Of necessity, this scale of
      measurement, to an American, if he happens to be a thoughtless man, must
      sound ludicrous. Accordingly, I remember a case in which an American
      writer indulges himself in the luxury of a little fibbing, by ascribing to
      an Englishman a pompous account of the Thames, constructed entirely upon
      American ideas of grandeur, and concluding in something like these terms:&mdash;"And,
      sir, arriving at London, this mighty father of rivers attains a breadth of
      at least two furlongs, having, in its winding course, traversed the
      astonishing distance of one hundred and seventy miles." And this the
      candid American thinks it fair to contrast with the scale of the
      Mississippi. Now, it is hardly worth while to answer a pure fiction
      gravely; else one might say that no Englishman out of Bedlam ever thought
      of looking in an island for the rivers of a continent, nor, consequently,
      could have thought of looking for the peculiar grandeur of the Thames in
      the length of its course, or in the extent of soil which it drains. Yet,
      if he <i>had</i> been so absurd, the American might have recollected that
      a river, not to be compared with the Thames even as to volume of water&mdash;viz.,
      the Tiber&mdash;has contrived to make itself heard of in this world for
      twenty-five centuries to an extent not reached as yet by any river,
      however corpulent, of his own land. The glory of the Thames is measured by
      the destiny of the population to which it ministers, by the commerce which
      it supports, by the grandeur of the empire in which, though far from the
      largest, it is the most influential stream. Upon some such scale, and not
      by a transfer of Columbian standards, is the course of our English mails
      to be valued. The American may fancy the effect of his own valuations to
      our English ears by supposing the case of a Siberian glorifying his
      country in these terms:&mdash;"These wretches, sir, in France and England,
      cannot march half a mile in any direction without finding a house where
      food can be had and lodging; whereas such is the noble desolation of our
      magnificent country that in many a direction for a thousand miles I will
      engage that a dog shall not find shelter from a snow-storm, nor a wren
      find an apology for breakfast."] miles&mdash;northwards for six hundred;
      and the sympathy of our Lombard Street friends at parting is exalted a
      hundredfold by a sort of visionary sympathy with the yet slumbering
      sympathies which in so vast a succession we are going to awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liberated from the embarrassments of the city, and issuing into the broad
      uncrowded avenues of the northern suburbs, we soon begin to enter upon our
      natural pace of ten miles an hour. In the broad light of the summer
      evening, the sun, perhaps, only just at the point of setting, we are seen
      from every storey of every house. Heads of every age crowd to the windows;
      young and old understand the language of our victorious symbols; and
      rolling volleys of sympathising cheers run along us, behind us, and before
      us. The beggar, rearing himself against the wall, forgets his lameness&mdash;real
      or assumed&mdash;thinks not of his whining trade, but stands erect, with
      bold exulting smiles, as we pass him. The victory has healed him, and
      says, Be thou whole! Women and children, from garrets alike and cellars,
      through infinite London, look down or look up with loving eyes upon our
      gay ribbons and our martial laurels; sometimes kiss their hands; sometimes
      hang out, as signals of affection, pocket-handkerchiefs, aprons, dusters,
      anything that, by catching the summer breezes, will express an aerial
      jubilation. On the London side of Barnet, to which we draw near within a
      few minutes after nine, observe that private carriage which is approaching
      us. The weather being so warm, the glasses are all down; and one may read,
      as on the stage of a theatre, everything that goes on within. It contains
      three ladies&mdash;one likely to be "mamma," and two of seventeen or
      eighteen, who are probably her daughters. What lovely animation, what
      beautiful unpremeditated pantomime, explaining to us every syllable that
      passes, in these ingenuous girls! By the sudden start and raising of the
      hands on first discovering our laurelled equipage, by the sudden movement
      and appeal to the elder lady from both of them, and by the heightened
      colour on their animated countenances, we can almost hear them saying,
      "See, see! Look at their laurels! Oh, mamma! there has been a great battle
      in Spain; and it has been a great victory." In a moment we are on the
      point of passing them. We passengers&mdash;I on the box, and the two on
      the roof behind me&mdash;raise our hats to the ladies; the coachman makes
      his professional salute with the whip; the guard even, though punctilious
      on the matter of his dignity as an officer under the crown, touches his
      hat. The ladies move to us, in return, with a winning graciousness of
      gesture; all smile on each side in a way that nobody could misunderstand,
      and that nothing short of a grand national sympathy could so
      instantaneously prompt. Will these ladies say that we are nothing to <i>them</i>?
      Oh no; they will not say <i>that</i>. They cannot deny&mdash;they do not
      deny&mdash;that for this night they are our sisters; gentle or simple,
      scholar or illiterate servant, for twelve hours to come, we on the outside
      have the honour to be their brothers. Those poor women, again, who stop to
      gaze upon us with delight at the entrance of Barnet, and seem, by their
      air of weariness, to be returning from labour&mdash;do you mean to say
      that they are washerwomen and charwomen? Oh, my poor friend, you are quite
      mistaken. I assure you they stand in a far higher rank; for this one night
      they feel themselves by birthright to be daughters of England, and answer
      to no humbler title.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every joy, however, even rapturous joy&mdash;such is the sad law of earth&mdash;may
      carry with it grief, or fear of grief, to some. Three miles beyond Barnet,
      we see approaching us another private carriage, nearly repeating the
      circumstances of the former case. Here, also, the glasses are all down;
      here, also, is an elderly lady seated; but the two daughters are missing;
      for the single young person sitting by the lady's side seems to be an
      attendant&mdash;so I judge from her dress, and her air of respectful
      reserve. The lady is in mourning; and her countenance expresses sorrow. At
      first she does not look up; so that I believe she is not aware of our
      approach, until she hears the measured beating of our horses' hoofs. Then
      she raises her eyes to settle them painfully on our triumphal equipage.
      Our decorations explain the case to her at once; but she beholds them with
      apparent anxiety, or even with terror. Some time before this, I, finding
      it difficult to hit a flying mark when embarrassed by the coachman's
      person and reins intervening, had given to the guard a "Courier" evening
      paper, containing the gazette, for the next carriage that might pass.
      Accordingly he tossed it in, so folded that the huge capitals expressing
      some such legend as GLORIOUS VICTORY might catch the eye at once. To see
      the paper, however, at all, interpreted as it was by our ensigns of
      triumph, explained everything; and, if the guard were right in thinking
      the lady to have received it with a gesture of horror, it could not be
      doubtful that she had suffered some deep personal affliction in connexion
      with this Spanish war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, now, was the case of one who, having formerly suffered, might,
      erroneously perhaps, be distressing herself with anticipations of another
      similar suffering. That same night, and hardly three hours later, occurred
      the reverse case. A poor woman, who too probably would find herself, in a
      day or two, to have suffered the heaviest of afflictions by the battle,
      blindly allowed herself to express an exultation so unmeasured in the news
      and its details as gave to her the appearance which amongst Celtic
      Highlanders is called <i>fey</i>. This was at some little town where we
      changed horses an hour or two after midnight. Some fair or wake had kept
      the people up out of their beds, and had occasioned a partial illumination
      of the stalls and booths, presenting an unusual but very impressive
      effect. We saw many lights moving about as we drew near; and perhaps the
      most striking scene on the whole route was our reception at this place.
      The flashing of torches and the beautiful radiance of blue lights
      (technically, Bengal lights) upon the heads of our horses; the fine effect
      of such a showery and ghostly illumination falling upon our flowers and
      glittering laurels [Footnote: "<i>Glittering laurels</i>":&mdash;I must
      observe that the colour of <i>green</i> suffers almost a spiritual change
      and exaltation under the effect of Bengal lights.]; whilst all around
      ourselves, that formed a centre of light, the darkness gathered on the
      rear and flanks in massy blackness: these optical splendours, together
      with the prodigious enthusiasm of the people, composed a picture at once
      scenical and affecting, theatrical and holy. As we staid for three or four
      minutes, I alighted; and immediately from a dismantled stall in the
      street, where no doubt she had been presiding through the earlier part of
      the night, advanced eagerly a middle-aged woman. The sight of my newspaper
      it was that had drawn her attention upon myself. The victory which we were
      carrying down to the provinces on <i>this</i> occasion was the imperfect
      one of Talavera&mdash;imperfect for its results, such was the virtual
      treachery of the Spanish general, Cuesta, but not imperfect in its
      ever-memorable heroism. I told her the main outline of the battle. The
      agitation of her enthusiasm had been so conspicuous when listening, and
      when first applying for information, that I could not but ask her if she
      had not some relative in the Peninsular army. Oh yes; her only son was
      there. In what regiment? He was a trooper in the 23d Dragoons. My heart
      sank within me as she made that answer. This sublime regiment, which an
      Englishman should never mention without raising his hat to their memory,
      had made the most memorable and effective charge recorded in military
      annals. They leaped their horses&mdash;<i>over</i> a trench where they
      could; <i>into</i> it, and with the result of death or mutilation, when
      they could <i>not</i>. What proportion cleared the trench is nowhere
      stated. Those who <i>did</i> closed up and went down upon the enemy with
      such divinity of fervour (I use the word <i>divinity</i> by design: the
      inspiration of God must have prompted this movement for those whom even
      then He was calling to His presence) that two results followed. As
      regarded the enemy, this 23d Dragoons, not, I believe, originally three
      hundred and fifty strong, paralysed a French column six thousand strong,
      then ascended the hill, and fixed the gaze of the whole French army. As
      regarded themselves, the 23d were supposed at first to have been barely
      not annihilated; but eventually, I believe, about one in four survived.
      And this, then, was the regiment&mdash;a regiment already for some hours
      glorified and hallowed to the ear of all London, as lying stretched, by a
      large majority, upon one bloody aceldama&mdash;in which the young trooper
      served whose mother was now talking in a spirit of such joyous enthusiasm.
      Did I tell her the truth? Had I the heart to break up her dreams? No.
      To-morrow, said I to myself&mdash;to-morrow, or the next day, will publish
      the worst. For one night more wherefore should she not sleep in peace?
      After to-morrow the chances are too many that peace will forsake her
      pillow. This brief respite, then, let her owe to <i>my</i> gift and <i>my</i>
      forbearance. But, if I told her not of the bloody price that had been
      paid, not therefore was I silent on the contributions from her son's
      regiment to that day's service and glory. I showed her not the funeral
      banners under which the noble regiment was sleeping. I lifted not the
      overshadowing laurels from the bloody trench in which horse and rider lay
      mangled together. But I told her how these dear children of England,
      officers and privates, had leaped their horses over all obstacles as gaily
      as hunters to the morning's chase. I told her how they rode their horses
      into the midst of death,&mdash;saying to myself, but not saying to <i>her</i>
      "and laid down their young lives for thee, O mother England! as willingly&mdash;poured
      out their noble blood as cheerfully&mdash;as ever, after a long day's
      sport, when infants, they had rested their weary heads upon their mother's
      knees, or had sunk to sleep in her arms." Strange it is, yet true, that
      she seemed to have no fears for her son's safety, even after this
      knowledge that the 23d Dragoons had been memorably engaged; but so much
      was she enraptured by the knowledge that <i>his</i> regiment, and
      therefore that <i>he</i>, had rendered conspicuous service in the dreadful
      conflict&mdash;a service which had actually made them, within the last
      twelve hours, the foremost topic of conversation in London&mdash;so
      absolutely was fear swallowed up in joy&mdash;that, in the mere simplicity
      of her fervent nature, the poor woman threw her arms round my neck, as she
      thought of her son, and gave to <i>me</i> the kiss which secretly was
      meant for <i>him</i>.

    <h2>
      SECTION II&mdash;THE VISION OF SUDDEN DEATH
    </h2>
    <p>
      What is to be taken as the predominant opinion of man, reflective and
      philosophic, upon SUDDEN DEATH? It is remarkable that, in different
      conditions of society, sudden death has been variously regarded as the
      consummation of an earthly career most fervently to be desired, or, again,
      as that consummation which is with most horror to be deprecated. Cæsar the
      Dictator, at his last dinner-party (<i>coena</i>), on the very evening
      before his assassination, when the minutes of his earthly career were
      numbered, being asked what death, in <i>his</i> judgment, might be
      pronounced the most eligible, replied "That which should be most sudden."
      On the other hand, the divine Litany of our English Church, when breathing
      forth supplications, as if in some representative character, for the whole
      human race prostrate before God, places such a death in the very van of
      horrors: "From lightning and tempest; from plague, pestilence, and famine;
      from battle and murder, and from SUDDEN DEATH&mdash;<i>Good Lord, deliver
      us</i>." Sudden death is here made to crown the climax in a grand ascent
      of calamities; it is ranked among the last of curses; and yet by the
      noblest of Romans it was ranked as the first of blessings. In that
      difference most readers will see little more than the essential difference
      between Christianity and Paganism. But this, on consideration, I doubt.
      The Christian Church may be right in its estimate of sudden death; and it
      is a natural feeling, though after all it may also be an infirm one, to
      wish for a quiet dismissal from life, as that which <i>seems</i> most
      reconcilable with meditation, with penitential retrospects, and with the
      humilities of farewell prayer. There does not, however, occur to me any
      direct scriptural warrant for this earnest petition of the English Litany,
      unless under a special construction of the word "sudden." It seems a
      petition indulged rather and conceded to human infirmity than exacted from
      human piety. It is not so much a doctrine built upon the eternities of the
      Christian system as a plausible opinion built upon special varieties of
      physical temperament. Let that, however, be as it may, two remarks suggest
      themselves as prudent restraints upon a doctrine which else <i>may</i>
      wander, and <i>has</i> wandered, into an uncharitable superstition. The
      first is this: that many people are likely to exaggerate the horror of a
      sudden death from the disposition to lay a false stress upon words or acts
      simply because by an accident they have become <i>final</i> words or acts.
      If a man dies, for instance, by some sudden death when he happens to be
      intoxicated, such a death is falsely regarded with peculiar horror; as
      though the intoxication were suddenly exalted into a blasphemy. But <i>that</i>
      is unphilosophic. The man was, or he was not, <i>habitually</i> a
      drunkard. If not, if his intoxication were a solitary accident, there can
      be no reason for allowing special emphasis to this act simply because
      through misfortune it became his final act. Nor, on the other hand, if it
      were no accident, but one of his <i>habitual</i> transgressions, will it
      be the more habitual or the more a transgression because some sudden
      calamity, surprising him, has caused this habitual transgression to be
      also a final one. Could the man have had any reason even dimly to foresee
      his own sudden death, there would have been a new feature in his act of
      intemperance&mdash;a feature of presumption and irreverence, as in one
      that, having known himself drawing near to the presence of God, should
      have suited his demeanour to an expectation so awful. But this is no part
      of the case supposed. And the only new element in the man's act is not any
      element of special immorality, but simply of special misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other remark has reference to the meaning of the word <i>sudden</i>.
      Very possibly Cæsar and the Christian Church do not differ in the way
      supposed,&mdash;that is, do not differ by any difference of doctrine as
      between Pagan and Christian views of the moral temper appropriate to
      death; but perhaps they are contemplating different cases. Both
      contemplate a violent death, a <i>Biathanatos</i>&mdash;death that is <i>biaios</i>,
      or, in other words, death that is brought about, not by internal and
      spontaneous change, but by active force having its origin from without. In
      this meaning the two authorities agree. Thus far they are in harmony. But
      the difference is that the Roman by the word "sudden" means <i>unlingering</i>,
      whereas the Christian Litany by "sudden death" means a death <i>without
      warning</i>, consequently without any available summons to religious
      preparation. The poor mutineer who kneels down to gather into his heart
      the bullets from twelve firelocks of his pitying comrades dies by a most
      sudden death in Cæsar's sense; one shock, one mighty spasm, one (possibly
      <i>not</i> one) groan, and all is over. But, in the sense of the Litany,
      the mutineer's death is far from sudden: his offence originally, his
      imprisonment, his trial, the interval between his sentence and its
      execution, having all furnished him with separate warnings of his fate&mdash;having
      all summoned him to meet it with solemn preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here at once, in this sharp verbal distinction, we comprehend the faithful
      earnestness with which a holy Christian Church pleads on behalf of her
      poor departing children that God would vouchsafe to them the last great
      privilege and distinction possible on a death-bed, viz., the opportunity
      of untroubled preparation for facing this mighty trial. Sudden death, as a
      mere variety in the modes of dying where death in some shape is
      inevitable, proposes a question of choice which, equally in the Roman and
      the Christian sense, will be variously answered according to each man's
      variety of temperament. Meantime, one aspect of sudden death there is, one
      modification, upon which no doubt can arise, that of all martyrdoms it is
      the most agitating&mdash;viz., where it surprises a man under
      circumstances which offer (or which seem to offer) some hurrying, flying,
      inappreciably minute chance of evading it. Sudden as the danger which it
      affronts must be any effort by which such an evasion can be accomplished.
      Even <i>that</i>, even the sickening necessity for hurrying in extremity
      where all hurry seems destined to be vain,&mdash;even that anguish is
      liable to a hideous exasperation in one particular case: viz., where the
      appeal is made not exclusively to the instinct of self-preservation, but
      to the conscience, on behalf of some other life besides your own,
      accidentally thrown upon <i>your</i> protection. To fail, to collapse in a
      service merely your own, might seem comparatively venial; though, in fact,
      it is far from venial. But to fail in a case where Providence has suddenly
      thrown into your hands the final interests of another,&mdash;a fellow
      creature shuddering between the gates of life and death: this, to a man of
      apprehensive conscience, would mingle the misery of an atrocious
      criminality with the misery of a bloody calamity. You are called upon, by
      the case supposed, possibly to die, but to die at the very moment when, by
      any even partial failure or effeminate collapse of your energies, you will
      be self-denounced as a murderer. You had but the twinkling of an eye for
      your effort, and that effort might have been unavailing; but to have risen
      to the level of such an effort would have rescued you, though not from
      dying, yet from dying as a traitor to your final and farewell duty.

      The situation here contemplated exposes a dreadful ulcer, lurking far down
      in the depths of human nature. It is not that men generally are summoned
      to face such awful trials. But potentially, and in shadowy outline, such a
      trial is moving subterraneously in perhaps all men's natures. Upon the
      secret mirror of our dreams such a trial is darkly projected, perhaps, to
      every one of us. That dream, so familiar to childhood, of meeting a lion,
      and, through languishing prostration in hope and the energies of hope,
      that constant sequel of lying down before the lion publishes the secret
      frailty of human nature&mdash;reveals its deep-seated falsehood to itself&mdash;records
      its abysmal treachery. Perhaps not one of us escapes that dream; perhaps,
      as by some sorrowful doom of man, that dream repeats for every one of us,
      through every generation, the original temptation in Eden. Every one of
      us, in this dream, has a bait offered to the infirm places of his own
      individual will; once again a snare is presented for tempting him into
      captivity to a luxury of ruin; once again, as in aboriginal Paradise, the
      man falls by his own choice; again, by infinite iteration, the ancient
      earth groans to Heaven, through her secret caves, over the weakness of her
      child. "Nature, from her seat, sighing through all her works," again
      "gives signs of woe that all is lost"; and again the counter-sigh is
      repeated to the sorrowing heavens for the endless rebellion against God.
      It is not without probability that in the world of dreams every one of us
      ratifies for himself the original transgression. In dreams, perhaps under
      some secret conflict of the midnight sleeper, lighted up to the
      consciousness at the time, but darkened to the memory as soon as all is
      finished, each several child of our mysterious race completes for himself
      the treason of the aboriginal fall.

      The incident, so memorable in itself by its features of horror, and so
      scenical by its grouping for the eye, which furnished the text for this
      reverie upon <i>Sudden Death</i> occurred to myself in the dead of night,
      as a solitary spectator, when seated on the box of the Manchester and
      Glasgow mail, in the second or third summer after Waterloo. I find it
      necessary to relate the circumstances, because they are such as could not
      have occurred unless under a singular combination of accidents. In those
      days, the oblique and lateral communications with many rural post-offices
      were so arranged, either through necessity or through defect of system, as
      to make it requisite for the main north-western mail (<i>i.e.</i>, the <i>down</i>
      mail) on reaching Manchester to halt for a number of hours; how many, I do
      not remember; six or seven, I think; but the result was that, in the
      ordinary course, the mail recommenced its journey northwards about
      midnight. Wearied with the long detention at a gloomy hotel, I walked out
      about eleven o'clock at night for the sake of fresh air; meaning to fall
      in with the mail and resume my seat at the post-office. The night,
      however, being yet dark, as the moon had scarcely risen, and the streets
      being at that hour empty, so as to offer no opportunities for asking the
      road, I lost my way, and did not reach the post-office until it was
      considerably past midnight; but, to my great relief (as it was important
      for me to be in Westmoreland by the morning), I saw in the huge saucer
      eyes of the mail, blazing through the gloom, an evidence that my chance
      was not yet lost. Past the time it was; but, by some rare accident, the
      mail was not even yet ready to start. I ascended to my seat on the box,
      where my cloak was still lying as it had lain at the Bridgewater Arms. I
      had left it there in imitation of a nautical discoverer, who leaves a bit
      of bunting on the shore of his discovery, by way of warning off the ground
      the whole human race, and notifying to the Christian and the heathen
      worlds, with his best compliments, that he has hoisted his
      pocket-handkerchief once and for ever upon that virgin soil: thenceforward
      claiming the <i>jus dominii</i> to the top of the atmosphere above it, and
      also the right of driving shafts to the centre of the earth below it; so
      that all people found after this warning either aloft in upper chambers of
      the atmosphere, or groping in subterraneous shafts, or squatting
      audaciously on the surface of the soil, will be treated as trespassers&mdash;kicked,
      that is to say, or decapitated, as circumstances may suggest, by their
      very faithful servant, the owner of the said pocket-handkerchief. In the
      present case, it is probable that my cloak might not have been respected,
      and the <i>jus gentium</i> might have been cruelly violated in my person&mdash;for,
      in the dark, people commit deeds of darkness, gas being a great ally of
      morality; but it so happened that on this night there was no other outside
      passenger; and thus the crime, which else was but too probable, missed
      fire for want of a criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having mounted the box, I took a small quantity of laudanum, having
      already travelled two hundred and fifty miles&mdash;viz., from a point
      seventy miles beyond London. In the taking of laudanum there was nothing
      extraordinary. But by accident it drew upon me the special attention of my
      assessor on the box, the coachman. And in <i>that</i> also there was
      nothing extraordinary. But by accident, and with great delight, it drew my
      own attention to the fact that this coachman was a monster in point of
      bulk, and that he had but one eye. In fact, he had been foretold by Virgil
      as
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum."
</pre>
    <p>
      He answered to the conditions in every one of the items:&mdash;1, a
      monster he was; 2, dreadful; 3, shapeless; 4, huge; 5, who had lost an
      eye. But why should <i>that</i> delight me? Had he been one of the
      Calendars in the "Arabian Nights," and had paid down his eye as the price
      of his criminal curiosity, what right had <i>I</i> to exult in his
      misfortune? I did <i>not</i> exult; I delighted in no man's punishment,
      though it were even merited. But these personal distinctions (Nos. 1, 2,
      3, 4, 5) identified in an instant an old friend of mine whom I had known
      in the south for some years as the most masterly of mail-coachmen. He was
      the man in all Europe that could (if <i>any</i> could) have driven
      six-in-hand full gallop over <i>Al Sirat</i>&mdash;that dreadful bridge of
      Mahomet, with no side battlements, and of <i>extra</i> room not enough for
      a razor's edge&mdash;leading right across the bottomless gulf. Under this
      eminent man, whom in Greek I cognominated Cyclops <i>Diphrélates</i>
      (Cyclops the Charioteer), I, and others known to me, studied the
      diphrelatic art. Excuse, reader, a word too elegant to be pedantic. As a
      pupil, though I paid extra fees, it is to be lamented that I did not stand
      high in his esteem. It showed his dogged honesty (though, observe, not his
      discernment) that he could not see my merits. Let us excuse his absurdity
      in this particular by remembering his want of an eye. Doubtless <i>that</i>
      made him blind to my merits. In the art of conversation, however, he
      admitted that I had the whip-hand of him. On the present occasion great
      joy was at our meeting. But what was Cyclops doing here? Had the medical
      men recommended northern air, or how? I collected, from such explanations
      as he volunteered, that he had an interest at stake in some suit-at-law
      now pending at Lancaster; so that probably he had got himself transferred
      to this station for the purpose of connecting with his professional
      pursuits an instant readiness for the calls of his lawsuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, what are we stopping for? Surely we have now waited long enough.
      Oh, this procrastinating mail, and this procrastinating post-office! Can't
      they take a lesson upon that subject from <i>me</i>? Some people have
      called <i>me</i> procrastinating. Yet you are witness, reader, that I was
      here kept waiting for the post-office. Will the post-office lay its hand
      on its heart, in its moments of sobriety, and assert that ever it waited
      for me? What are they about? The guard tells me that there is a large
      extra accumulation of foreign mails this night, owing to irregularities
      caused by war, by wind, by weather, in the packet service, which as yet
      does not benefit at all by steam. For an <i>extra</i> hour, it seems, the
      post-office has been engaged in threshing out the pure wheaten
      correspondence of Glasgow, and winnowing it from the chaff of all baser
      intermediate towns. But at last all is finished. Sound your horn, guard!
      Manchester, good-bye! we've lost an hour by your criminal conduct at the
      post-office: which, however, though I do not mean to part with a
      serviceable ground of complaint, and one which really <i>is</i> such for
      the horses, to me secretly is an advantage, since it compels us to look
      sharply for this lost hour amongst the next eight or nine, and to recover
      it (if we can) at the rate of one mile extra per hour. Off we are at last,
      and at eleven miles an hour; and for the moment I detect no changes in the
      energy or in the skill of Cyclops.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Manchester to Kendal, which virtually (though not in law) is the
      capital of Westmoreland, there were at this time seven stages of eleven
      miles each. The first five of these, counting from Manchester, terminate
      in Lancaster; which is therefore fifty-five miles north of Manchester, and
      the same distance exactly from Liverpool. The first three stages terminate
      in Preston (called, by way of distinction from other towns of that name,
      <i>Proud</i> Preston); at which place it is that the separate roads from
      Liverpool and from Manchester to the north become confluent. [Footnote: "<i>Confluent</i>":&mdash;Suppose
      a capital Y (the Pythagorean letter): Lancaster is at the foot of this
      letter; Liverpool at the top of the <i>right</i> branch; Manchester at the
      top of the <i>left</i>; Proud Preston at the centre, where the two
      branches unite. It is thirty-three miles along either of the two branches;
      it is twenty-two miles along the stem,&mdash;viz., from Preston in the
      middle to Lancaster at the root. There's a lesson in geography for the
      reader!] Within these first three stages lay the foundation, the progress,
      and termination of our night's adventure. During the first stage, I found
      out that Cyclops was mortal: he was liable to the shocking affection of
      sleep&mdash;a thing which previously I had never suspected. If a man
      indulges in the vicious habit of sleeping, all the skill in aurigation of
      Apollo himself, with the horses of Aurora to execute his notions, avails
      him nothing. "Oh, Cyclops!" I exclaimed, "thou art mortal. My friend, thou
      snorest." Through the first eleven miles, however, this infirmity&mdash;which
      I grieve to say that he shared with the whole Pagan Pantheon&mdash;betrayed
      itself only by brief snatches. On waking up, he made an apology for
      himself which, instead of mending matters, laid open a gloomy vista of
      coming disasters. The summer assizes, he reminded me, were now going on at
      Lancaster: in consequence of which for three nights and three days he had
      not lain down on a bed. During the day he was waiting for his own summons
      as a witness on the trial in which he was interested, or else, lest he
      should be missing at the critical moment, was drinking with the other
      witnesses under the pastoral surveillance of the attorneys. During the
      night, or that part of it which at sea would form the middle watch, he was
      driving. This explanation certainly accounted for his drowsiness, but in a
      way which made it much more alarming; since now, after several days'
      resistance to this infirmity, at length he was steadily giving way.
      Throughout the second stage he grew more and more drowsy. In the second
      mile of the third stage he surrendered himself finally and without a
      struggle to his perilous temptation. All his past resistance had but
      deepened the weight of this final oppression. Seven atmospheres of sleep
      rested upon him; and, to consummate the case, our worthy guard, after
      singing "Love amongst the Roses" for perhaps thirty times, without
      invitation and without applause, had in revenge moodily resigned himself
      to slumber&mdash;not so deep, doubtless, as the coachman's, but deep
      enough for mischief. And thus at last, about ten miles from Preston, it
      came about that I found myself left in charge of his Majesty's London and
      Glasgow mail, then running at the least twelve miles an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      What made this negligence less criminal than else it must have been
      thought was the condition of the roads at night during the assizes. At
      that time, all the law business of populous Liverpool, and also of
      populous Manchester, with its vast cincture of populous rural districts,
      was called up by ancient usage to the tribunal of Lilliputian Lancaster.
      To break up this old traditional usage required, 1, a conflict with
      powerful established interests, 2, a large system of new arrangements, and
      3, a new parliamentary statute. But as yet this change was merely in
      contemplation. As things were at present, twice in the year [Footnote: "<i>Twice
      in the year</i>":&mdash;There were at that time only two assizes even in
      the most populous counties&mdash;viz., the Lent Assizes and the Summer
      Assizes.] so vast a body of business rolled northwards from the southern
      quarter of the county that for a fortnight at least it occupied the severe
      exertions of two judges in its despatch. The consequence of this was that
      every horse available for such a service, along the whole line of road,
      was exhausted in carrying down the multitudes of people who were parties
      to the different suits. By sunset, therefore, it usually happened that,
      through utter exhaustion amongst men and horses, the road sank into
      profound silence. Except the exhaustion in the vast adjacent county of
      York from a contested election, no such silence succeeding to no such
      fiery uproar was ever witnessed in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion the usual silence and solitude prevailed along the road.
      Not a hoof nor a wheel was to be heard. And, to strengthen this false
      luxurious confidence in the noiseless roads, it happened also that the
      night was one of peculiar solemnity and peace. For my own part, though
      slightly alive to the possibilities of peril, I had so far yielded to the
      influence of the mighty calm as to sink into a profound reverie. The month
      was August; in the middle of which lay my own birthday&mdash;a festival to
      every thoughtful man suggesting solemn and often sigh-born [Footnote: "<i>Sigh-born</i>":&mdash;I
      owe the suggestion of this word to an obscure remembrance of a beautiful
      phrase in "Giraldus Cambrensis"&mdash;viz., <i>suspiriosæ cogitationes</i>.]
      thoughts. The county was my own native county&mdash;upon which, in its
      southern section, more than upon any equal area known to man past or
      present, had descended the original curse of labour in its heaviest form,
      not mastering the bodies only of men, as of slaves, or criminals in mines,
      but working through the fiery will. Upon no equal space of earth was, or
      ever had been, the same energy of human power put forth daily. At this
      particular season also of the assizes, that dreadful hurricane of flight
      and pursuit, as it might have seemed to a stranger, which swept to and
      from Lancaster all day long, hunting the county up and down, and regularly
      subsiding back into silence about sunset, could not fail (when united with
      this permanent distinction of Lancashire as the very metropolis and
      citadel of labour) to point the thoughts pathetically upon that
      counter-vision of rest, of saintly repose from strife and sorrow, towards
      which, as to their secret haven, the profounder aspirations of man's heart
      are in solitude continually travelling. Obliquely upon our left we were
      nearing the sea; which also must, under the present circumstances, be
      repeating the general state of halcyon repose. The sea, the atmosphere,
      the light, bore each an orchestral part in this universal lull. Moonlight
      and the first timid tremblings of the dawn were by this time blending; and
      the blendings were brought into a still more exquisite state of unity by a
      slight silvery mist, motionless and dreamy, that covered the woods and
      fields, but with a veil of equable transparency. Except the feet of our
      own horses,&mdash;which, running on a sandy margin of the road, made but
      little disturbance,&mdash;there was no sound abroad. In the clouds and on
      the earth prevailed the same majestic peace; and, in spite of all that the
      villain of a schoolmaster has done for the ruin of our sublimer thoughts,
      which are the thoughts of our infancy, we still believe in no such
      nonsense as a limited atmosphere. Whatever we may swear with our false
      feigning lips, in our faithful hearts we still believe, and must for ever
      believe, in fields of air traversing the total gulf between earth and the
      central heavens. Still, in the confidence of children that tread without
      fear every chamber in their father's house, and to whom no door is closed,
      we, in that Sabbatic vision which sometimes is revealed for an hour upon
      nights like this, ascend with easy steps from the sorrow-stricken fields
      of earth upwards to the sandals of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, from thoughts like these I was awakened to a sullen sound, as of
      some motion on the distant road. It stole upon the air for a moment; I
      listened in awe; but then it died away. Once roused, however, I could not
      but observe with alarm the quickened motion of our horses. Ten years'
      experience had made my eye learned in the valuing of motion; and I saw
      that we were now running thirteen miles an hour. I pretend to no presence
      of mind. On the contrary, my fear is that I am miserably and shamefully
      deficient in that quality as regards action. The palsy of doubt and
      distraction hangs like some guilty weight of dark unfathomed remembrances
      upon my energies when the signal is flying for <i>action</i>. But, on the
      other hand, this accursed gift I have, as regards <i>thought</i>, that in
      the first step towards the possibility of a misfortune I see its total
      evolution; in the radix of the series I see too certainly and too
      instantly its entire expansion; in the first syllable of the dreadful
      sentence I read already the last. It was not that I feared for ourselves.
      <i>Us</i> our bulk and impetus charmed against peril in any collision. And
      I had ridden through too many hundreds of perils that were frightful to
      approach, that were matter of laughter to look back upon, the first face
      of which was horror, the parting face a jest&mdash;for any anxiety to rest
      upon <i>our</i> interests. The mail was not built, I felt assured, nor
      bespoke, that could betray <i>me</i> who trusted to its protection. But
      any carriage that we could meet would be frail and light in comparison of
      ourselves. And I remarked this ominous accident of our situation,&mdash;we
      were on the wrong side of the road. But then, it may be said, the other
      party, if other there was, might also be on the wrong side; and two wrongs
      might make a right. <i>That</i> was not likely. The same motive which had
      drawn <i>us</i> to the right-hand side of the road&mdash;viz., the luxury
      of the soft beaten sand as contrasted with the paved centre&mdash;would
      prove attractive to others. The two adverse carriages would therefore, to
      a certainty, be travelling on the same side; and from this side, as not
      being ours in law, the crossing over to the other would, of course, be
      looked for from <i>us</i>. [Footnote: It is true that, according to the
      law of the case as established by legal precedents, all carriages were
      required to give way before royal equipages, and therefore before the mail
      as one of them. But this only increased the danger, as being a regulation
      very imperfectly made known, very unequally enforced, and therefore often
      embarrassing the movements on both sides.] Our lamps, still lighted, would
      give the impression of vigilance on our part. And every creature that met
      us would rely upon <i>us</i> for quartering. [Footnote: "<i>Quartering</i>":&mdash;This
      is the technical word, and, I presume, derived from the French <i>cartayer</i>,
      to evade a rut or any obstacle.] All this, and if the separate links of
      the anticipation had been a thousand times more, I saw, not discursively,
      or by effort, or by succession, but by one flash of horrid simultaneous
      intuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this steady though rapid anticipation of the evil which <i>might</i>
      be gathering ahead, ah! what a sullen mystery of fear, what a sigh of woe,
      was that which stole upon the air, as again the far-off sound of a wheel
      was heard! A whisper it was&mdash;a whisper from, perhaps, four miles off&mdash;secretly
      announcing a ruin that, being foreseen, was not the less inevitable; that,
      being known, was not therefore healed. What could be done&mdash;who was it
      that could do it&mdash;to check the storm-flight of these maniacal horses?
      Could I not seize the reins from the grasp of the slumbering coachman?
      You, reader, think that it would have been in <i>your</i> power to do so.
      And I quarrel not with your estimate of yourself. But, from the way in
      which the coachman's hand was viced between his upper and lower thigh,
      this was impossible. Easy was it? See, then, that bronze equestrian
      statue. The cruel rider has kept the bit in his horse's mouth for two
      centuries. Unbridle him for a minute, if you please, and wash his mouth
      with water. Easy was it? Unhorse me, then, that imperial rider; knock me
      those marble feet from those marble stirrups of Charlemagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sounds ahead strengthened, and were now too clearly the sounds of
      wheels. Who and what could it be? Was it industry in a taxed cart? Was it
      youthful gaiety in a gig? Was it sorrow that loitered, or joy that raced?
      For as yet the snatches of sound were too intermitting, from distance, to
      decipher the character of the motion. Whoever were the travellers,
      something must be done to warn them. Upon the other party rests the active
      responsibility, but upon <i>us</i>&mdash;and, woe is me! that <i>us</i>
      was reduced to my frail opium-shattered self&mdash;rests the
      responsibility of warning. Yet, how should this be accomplished? Might I
      not sound the guard's horn? Already, on the first thought, I was making my
      way over the roof of the guard's seat. But this, from the accident which I
      have mentioned, of the foreign mails being piled upon the roof, was a
      difficult and even dangerous attempt to one cramped by nearly three
      hundred miles of outside travelling. And, fortunately, before I had lost
      much time in the attempt, our frantic horses swept round an angle of the
      road which opened upon us that final stage where the collision must be
      accomplished and the catastrophe sealed. All was apparently finished. The
      court was sitting; the case was heard; the judge had finished; and only
      the verdict was yet in arrear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before us lay an avenue straight as an arrow, six hundred yards, perhaps,
      in length; and the umbrageous trees, which rose in a regular line from
      either side, meeting high overhead, gave to it the character of a
      cathedral aisle. These trees lent a deeper solemnity to the early light;
      but there was still light enough to perceive, at the further end of this
      Gothic aisle, a frail reedy gig, in which were seated a young man, and by
      his side a young lady. Ah, young sir! what are you about? If it is
      requisite that you should whisper your communications to this young lady&mdash;though
      really I see nobody, at an hour and on a road so solitary, likely to
      overhear you&mdash;is it therefore requisite that you should carry your
      lips forward to hers? The little carriage is creeping on at one mile an
      hour; and the parties within it, being thus tenderly engaged, are
      naturally bending down their heads. Between them and eternity, to all
      human calculation, there is but a minute and a half. Oh heavens! what is
      it that I shall do? Speaking or acting, what help can I offer? Strange it
      is, and to a mere auditor of the tale might seem laughable, that I should
      need a suggestion from the "Iliad" to prompt the sole resource that
      remained. Yet so it was. Suddenly I remembered the shout of Achilles, and
      its effect. But could I pretend to shout like the son of Peleus, aided by
      Pallas? No: but then I needed not the shout that should alarm all Asia
      militant; such a shout would suffice as might carry terror into the hearts
      of two thoughtless young people and one gig-horse. I shouted&mdash;and the
      young man heard me not. A second time I shouted&mdash;and now he heard me,
      for now he raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, then, all had been done that, by me, <i>could</i> be done; more on
      <i>my</i> part was not possible. Mine had been the first step; the second
      was for the young man; the third was for God. If, said I, this stranger is
      a brave man, and if indeed he loves the young girl at his side&mdash;or,
      loving her not, if he feels the obligation, pressing upon every man worthy
      to be called a man, of doing his utmost for a woman confided to his
      protection&mdash;he will at least make some effort to save her. If <i>that</i>
      fails, he will not perish the more, or by a death more cruel, for having
      made it; and he will die as a brave man should, with his face to the
      danger, and with his arm about the woman that he sought in vain to save.
      But, if he makes no effort,&mdash;shrinking without a struggle from his
      duty,&mdash;he himself will not the less certainly perish for this
      baseness of poltroonery. He will die no less: and why not? Wherefore
      should we grieve that there is one craven less in the world? No; <i>let</i>
      him perish, without a pitying thought of ours wasted upon him; and, in
      that case, all our grief will be reserved for the fate of the helpless
      girl who now, upon the least shadow of failure in <i>him</i>, must by the
      fiercest of translations&mdash;must without time for a prayer&mdash;must
      within seventy seconds stand before the judgment-seat of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But craven he was not: sudden had been the call upon him, and sudden was
      his answer to the call. He saw, he heard, he comprehended, the ruin that
      was coming down: already its gloomy shadow darkened above him; and already
      he was measuring his strength to deal with it. Ah! what a vulgar thing
      does courage seem when we see nations buying it and selling it for a
      shilling a-day: ah! what a sublime thing does courage seem when some
      fearful summons on the great deeps of life carries a man, as if running
      before a hurricane, up to the giddy crest of some tumultuous crisis from
      which lie two courses, and a voice says to him audibly, "One way lies
      hope; take the other, and mourn for ever!" How grand a triumph if, even
      then, amidst the raving of all around him, and the frenzy of the danger,
      the man is able to confront his situation&mdash;is able to retire for a
      moment into solitude with God, and to seek his counsel from <i>Him!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      For seven seconds, it might be, of his seventy, the stranger settled his
      countenance steadfastly upon us, as if to search and value every element
      in the conflict before him. For five seconds more of his seventy he sat
      immovably, like one that mused on some great purpose. For five more,
      perhaps, he sat with eyes upraised, like one that prayed in sorrow, under
      some extremity of doubt, for light that should guide him to the better
      choice. Then suddenly he rose; stood upright; and, by a powerful strain
      upon the reins, raising his horse's fore-feet from the ground, he slewed
      him round on the pivot of his hind-legs, so as to plant the little
      equipage in a position nearly at right angles to ours. Thus far his
      condition was not improved; except as a first step had been taken towards
      the possibility of a second. If no more were done, nothing was done; for
      the little carriage still occupied the very centre of our path, though in
      an altered direction. Yet even now it may not be too late: fifteen of the
      seventy seconds may still be unexhausted; and one almighty bound may avail
      to clear the ground. Hurry, then, hurry! for the flying moments&mdash;<i>they</i>
      hurry. Oh, hurry, hurry, my brave young man! for the cruel hoofs of our
      horses&mdash;<i>they</i> also hurry! Fast are the flying moments, faster
      are the hoofs of our horses. But fear not for <i>him</i>, if human energy
      can suffice; faithful was he that drove to his terrific duty; faithful was
      the horse to <i>his</i> command. One blow, one impulse given with voice
      and hand, by the stranger, one rush from the horse, one bound as if in the
      act of rising to a fence, landed the docile creature's forefeet upon the
      crown or arching centre of the road. The larger half of the little
      equipage had then cleared our over-towering shadow: <i>that</i> was
      evident even to my own agitated sight. But it mattered little that one
      wreck should float off in safety if upon the wreck that perished were
      embarked the human freightage. The rear part of the carriage&mdash;was <i>that</i>
      certainly beyond the line of absolute ruin? What power could answer the
      question? Glance of eye, thought of man, wing of angel, which of these had
      speed enough to sweep between the question and the answer, and divide the
      one from the other? Light does not tread upon the steps of light more
      indivisibly than did our all-conquering arrival upon the escaping efforts
      of the gig. <i>That</i> must the young man have felt too plainly. His back
      was now turned to us; not by sight could he any longer communicate with
      the peril; but, by the dreadful rattle of our harness, too truly had his
      ear been instructed that all was finished as regarded any effort of <i>his</i>.
      Already in resignation he had rested from his struggle; and perhaps in his
      heart he was whispering, "Father, which art in heaven, do Thou finish
      above what I on earth have attempted." Faster than ever mill-race we ran
      past them in our inexorable flight. Oh, raving of hurricanes that must
      have sounded in their young ears at the moment of our transit! Even in
      that moment the thunder of collision spoke aloud. Either with the
      swingle-bar, or with the haunch of our near leader, we had struck the
      off-wheel of the little gig; which stood rather obliquely, and not quite
      so far advanced as to be accurately parallel with the near-wheel. The
      blow, from the fury of our passage, resounded terrifically. I rose in
      horror, to gaze upon the ruins we might have caused. From my elevated
      station I looked down, and looked back upon the scene; which in a moment
      told its own tale, and wrote all its records on my heart for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the map of the passion that now had finished. The horse was
      planted immovably, with his fore-feet upon the paved crest of the central
      road. He of the whole party might be supposed untouched by the passion of
      death. The little cany carriage&mdash;partly, perhaps, from the violent
      torsion of the wheels in its recent movement, partly from the thundering
      blow we had given to it&mdash;as if it sympathised with human horror, was
      all alive with tremblings and shiverings. The young man trembled not, nor
      shivered. He sat like a rock. But <i>his</i> was the steadiness of
      agitation frozen into rest by horror. As yet he dared not to look round;
      for he knew that, if anything remained to do, by him it could no longer be
      done. And as yet he knew not for certain if their safety were
      accomplished. But the lady&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lady&mdash;! Oh, heavens! will that spectacle ever depart from my
      dreams, as she rose and sank upon her seat, sank and rose, threw up her
      arms wildly to heaven, clutched at some visionary object in the air,
      fainting, praying, raving, despairing? Figure to yourself, reader, the
      elements of the case; suffer me to recall before your mind the
      circumstances of that unparalleled situation. From the silence and deep
      peace of this saintly summer night&mdash;from the pathetic blending of
      this sweet moonlight, dawnlight, dreamlight&mdash;from the manly
      tenderness of this flattering, whispering, murmuring love&mdash;suddenly
      as from the woods and fields&mdash;suddenly as from the chambers of the
      air opening in revelation&mdash;suddenly as from the ground yawning at her
      feet, leaped upon her, with the flashing of cataracts, Death the crowned
      phantom, with all the equipage of his terrors, and the tiger roar of his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moments were numbered; the strife was finished; the vision was closed.
      In the twinkling of an eye, our flying horses had carried us to the
      termination of the umbrageous aisle; at the right angles we wheeled into
      our former direction; the turn of the road carried the scene out of my
      eyes in an instant, and swept it into my dreams for ever.

        "Whence the sound

      Passion of sudden death! that once in youth I read and interpreted by the
      shadows of thy averted signs [Footnote: "<i>Averted signs</i>":&mdash;I
      read the course and changes of the lady's agony in the succession of her
      involuntary gestures; but it must be remembered that I read all this from
      the rear, never once catching the lady's full face, and even her profile
      imperfectly.]!&mdash;rapture of panic taking the shape (which amongst
      tombs in churches I have seen) of woman bursting her sepulchral bonds&mdash;of
      woman's Ionic form bending forward from the ruins of her grave with
      arching foot, with eyes upraised, with clasped adoring hands&mdash;waiting,
      watching, trembling, praying for the trumpet's call to rise from dust for
      ever! Ah, vision too fearful of shuddering humanity on the brink of
      almighty abysses!&mdash;vision that didst start back, that didst reel
      away, like a shrivelling scroll from before the wrath of fire racing on
      the wings of the wind! Epilepsy so brief of horror, wherefore is it that
      thou canst not die? Passing so suddenly into darkness, wherefore is it
      that still thou sheddest thy sad funeral blights upon the gorgeous mosaics
      of dreams? Fragment of music too passionate, heard once, and heard no
      more, what aileth thee, that thy deep rolling chords come up at intervals
      through all the worlds of sleep, and after forty years have lost no
      element of horror?

    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      Lo, it is summer&mdash;almighty summer! The everlasting gates of life and
      summer are thrown open wide; and on the ocean, tranquil and verdant as a
      savannah, the unknown lady from the dreadful vision and I myself are
      floating&mdash;she upon a fairy pinnace, and I upon an English
      three-decker. Both of us are wooing gales of festal happiness within the
      domain of our common country, within that ancient watery park, within the
      pathless chase of ocean, where England takes her pleasure as a huntress
      through winter and summer, from the rising to the setting sun. Ah, what a
      wilderness of floral beauty was hidden, or was suddenly revealed, upon the
      tropic islands through which the pinnace moved! And upon her deck what a
      bevy of human flowers: young women how lovely, young men how noble, that
      were dancing together, and slowly drifting towards <i>us</i> amidst music
      and incense, amidst blossoms from forests and gorgeous corymbi from
      vintages, amidst natural carolling, and the echoes of sweet girlish
      laughter. Slowly the pinnace nears us, gaily she hails us, and silently
      she disappears beneath the shadow of our mighty bows. But then, as at some
      signal from heaven, the music, and the carols, and the sweet echoing of
      girlish laughter&mdash;all are hushed. What evil has smitten the pinnace,
      meeting or overtaking her? Did ruin to our friends couch within our own
      dreadful shadow? Was our shadow the shadow of death? I looked over the bow
      for an answer, and, behold! the pinnace was dismantled; the revel and the
      revellers were found no more; the glory of the vintage was dust; and the
      forests with their beauty were left without a witness upon the seas. "But
      where," and I turned to our crew&mdash;"where are the lovely women that
      danced beneath the awning of flowers and clustering corymbi? Whither have
      fled the noble young men that danced with <i>them</i>?" Answer there was
      none. But suddenly the man at the mast-head, whose countenance darkened
      with alarm, cried out, "Sail on the weather beam! Down she comes upon us:
      in seventy seconds she also will founder."
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      I looked to the weather side, and the summer had departed. The sea was
      rocking, and shaken with gathering wrath. Upon its surface sat mighty
      mists, which grouped themselves into arches and long cathedral aisles.
      Down one of these, with the fiery pace of a quarrel from a cross-bow, ran
      a frigate right athwart our course. "Are they mad?" some voice exclaimed
      from our deck. "Do they woo their ruin?" But in a moment, as she was close
      upon us, some impulse of a heady current or local vortex gave a wheeling
      bias to her course, and off she forged without a shock. As she ran past
      us, high aloft amongst the shrouds stood the lady of the pinnace. The
      deeps opened ahead in malice to receive her, towering surges of foam ran
      after her, the billows were fierce to catch her. But far away she was
      borne into desert spaces of the sea: whilst still by sight I followed her,
      as she ran before the howling gale, chased by angry sea-birds and by
      maddening billows; still I saw her, as at the moment when she ran past us,
      standing amongst the shrouds, with her white draperies streaming before
      the wind. There she stood, with hair dishevelled, one hand clutched
      amongst the tackling&mdash;rising, sinking, fluttering, trembling,
      praying; there for leagues I saw her as she stood, raising at intervals
      one hand to heaven, amidst the fiery crests of the pursuing waves and the
      raving of the storm; until at last, upon a sound from afar of malicious
      laughter and mockery, all was hidden for ever in driving showers; and
      afterwards, but when I knew not, nor how.

    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sweet funeral bells from some incalculable distance, wailing over the dead
      that die before the dawn, awakened me as I slept in a boat moored to some
      familiar shore. The morning twilight even then was breaking; and, by the
      dusky revelations which it spread, I saw a girl, adorned with a garland of
      white roses about her head for some great festival, running along the
      solitary strand in extremity of haste. Her running was the running of
      panic; and often she looked back as to some dreadful enemy in the rear.
      But, when I leaped ashore, and followed on her steps to warn her of a
      peril in front, alas! from me she fled as from another peril, and vainly I
      shouted to her of quicksands that lay ahead. Faster and faster she ran;
      round a promontory of rocks she wheeled out of sight; in an instant I also
      wheeled round it, but only to see the treacherous sands gathering above
      her head. Already her person was buried; only the fair young head and the
      diadem of white roses around it were still visible to the pitying heavens;
      and, last of all, was visible one white marble arm. I saw by the early
      twilight this fair young head, as it was sinking down to darkness&mdash;saw
      this marble arm, as it rose above her head and her treacherous grave,
      tossing, faltering, rising, clutching, as at some false deceiving hand
      stretched out from the clouds&mdash;saw this marble arm uttering her dying
      hope, and then uttering her dying despair. The head, the diadem, the arm&mdash;these
      all had sunk; at last over these also the cruel quicksand had closed; and
      no memorial of the fair young girl remained on earth, except my own
      solitary tears, and the funeral bells from the desert seas, that, rising
      again more softly, sang a requiem over the grave of the buried child, and
      over her blighted dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat, and wept in secret the tears that men have ever given to the memory
      of those that died before the dawn, and by the treachery of earth, our
      mother. But suddenly the tears and funeral bells were hushed by a shout as
      of many nations, and by a roar as from some great king's artillery,
      advancing rapidly along the valleys, and heard afar by echoes from the
      mountains. "Hush!" I said, as I bent my ear earthwards to listen&mdash;"hush!&mdash;this
      either is the very anarchy of strife, or else"&mdash;and then I listened
      more profoundly, and whispered as I raised my head&mdash;"or else, oh
      heavens! it is <i>victory</i> that is final, victory that swallows up all
      strife."
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      Immediately, in trance, I was carried over land and sea to some distant
      kingdom, and placed upon a triumphal car, amongst companions crowned with
      laurel. The darkness of gathering midnight, brooding over all the land,
      hid from us the mighty crowds that were weaving restlessly about ourselves
      as a centre: we heard them, but saw them not. Tidings had arrived, within
      an hour, of a grandeur that measured itself against centuries; too full of
      pathos they were, too full of joy, to utter themselves by other language
      than by tears, by restless anthems, and <i>Te Deums</i> reverberated from
      the choirs and orchestras of earth. These tidings we that sat upon the
      laurelled car had it for our privilege to publish amongst all nations. And
      already, by signs audible through the darkness, by snortings and
      tramplings, our angry horses, that knew no fear or fleshly weariness,
      upbraided us with delay. Wherefore <i>was</i> it that we delayed? We
      waited for a secret word, that should bear witness to the hope of nations
      as now accomplished for ever. At midnight the secret word arrived; which
      word was&mdash;<i>Waterloo and Recovered Christendom!</i> The dreadful
      word shone by its own light; before us it went; high above our leaders'
      heads it rode, and spread a golden light over the paths which we
      traversed. Every city, at the presence of the secret word, threw open its
      gates. The rivers were conscious as we crossed. All the forests, as we ran
      along their margins, shivered in homage to the secret word. And the
      darkness comprehended it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours after midnight we approached a mighty Minster. Its gates, which
      rose to the clouds, were closed. But, when the dreadful word that rode
      before us reached them with its golden light, silently they moved back
      upon their hinges; and at a flying gallop our equipage entered the grand
      aisle of the cathedral. Headlong was our pace; and at every altar, in the
      little chapels and oratories to the right hand and left of our course, the
      lamps, dying or sickening, kindled anew in sympathy with the secret word
      that was flying past. Forty leagues we might have run in the cathedral,
      and as yet no strength of morning light had reached us, when before us we
      saw the aerial galleries of organ and choir. Every pinnacle of fretwork,
      every station of advantage amongst the traceries, was crested by
      white-robed choristers that sang deliverance; that wept no more tears, as
      once their fathers had wept; but at intervals that sang together to the
      generations, saying,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Chant the deliverer's praise in every tongue,"
</pre>
    <p>
      and receiving answers from afar,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Such as once in heaven and earth were sung."
</pre>
    <p>
      And of their chanting was no end; of our headlong pace was neither pause
      nor slackening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus as we ran like torrents&mdash;thus as we swept with bridal rapture
      over the Campo Santo [Footnote: "<i>Campo Santo</i>":&mdash;It is probable
      that most of my readers will be acquainted with the history of the Campo
      Santo (or cemetery) at Pisa, composed of earth brought from Jerusalem from
      a bed of sanctity as the highest prize which the noble piety of crusaders
      could ask or imagine. To readers who are unacquainted with England, or who
      (being English) are yet unacquainted with the cathedral cities of England,
      it may be right to mention that the graves within-side the cathedrals
      often form a flat pavement over which carriages and horses <i>might</i>
      run; and perhaps a boyish remembrance of one particular cathedral, across
      which I had seen passengers walk and burdens carried, as about two
      centuries back they were through the middle of St. Paul's in London, may
      have assisted my dream.] of the cathedral graves&mdash;suddenly we became
      aware of a vast necropolis rising upon the far-off horizon&mdash;a city of
      sepulchres, built within the saintly cathedral for the warrior dead that
      rested from their feuds on earth. Of purple granite was the necropolis;
      yet, in the first minute, it lay like a purple stain upon the horizon, so
      mighty was the distance. In the second minute it trembled through many
      changes, growing into terraces and towers of wondrous altitude, so mighty
      was the pace. In the third minute already, with our dreadful gallop, we
      were entering its suburbs. Vast sarcophagi rose on every side, having
      towers and turrets that, upon the limits of the central aisle, strode
      forward with haughty intrusion, that ran back with mighty shadows into
      answering recesses. Every sarcophagus showed many bas-reliefs&mdash;bas-reliefs
      of battles and of battle-fields; battles from forgotten ages, battles from
      yesterday; battle-fields that, long since, nature had healed and
      reconciled to herself with the sweet oblivion of flowers; battle-fields
      that were yet angry and crimson with carnage. Where the terraces ran,
      there did <i>we</i> run; where the towers curved, there did <i>we</i>
      curve. With the flight of swallows our horses swept round every angle.
      Like rivers in flood wheeling round headlands, like hurricanes that ride
      into the secrets of forests, faster than ever light unwove the mazes of
      darkness, our flying equipage carried earthly passions, kindled warrior
      instincts, amongst the dust that lay around us&mdash;dust oftentimes of
      our noble fathers that had slept in God from Crécy to Trafalgar. And now
      had we reached the last sarcophagus, now were we abreast of the last
      bas-relief, already had we recovered the arrow-like flight of the
      illimitable central aisle, when coming up this aisle to meet us we beheld
      afar off a female child, that rode in a carriage as frail as flowers. The
      mists which went before her hid the fawns that drew her, but could not
      hide the shells and tropic flowers with which she played&mdash;but could
      not hide the lovely smiles by which she uttered her trust in the mighty
      cathedral, and in the cherubim that looked down upon her from the mighty
      shafts of its pillars. Face to face she was meeting us; face to face she
      rode, as if danger there were none. "Oh, baby!" I exclaimed, "shalt thou
      be the ransom for Waterloo? Must we, that carry tidings of great joy to
      every people, be messengers of ruin to thee!" In horror I rose at the
      thought; but then also, in horror at the thought, rose one that was
      sculptured on a bas-relief&mdash;a Dying Trumpeter. Solemnly from the
      field of battle he rose to his feet; and, unslinging his stony trumpet,
      carried it, in his dying anguish, to his stony lips&mdash;sounding once,
      and yet once again; proclamation that, in <i>thy</i> ears, oh baby! spoke
      from the battlements of death. Immediately deep shadows fell between us,
      and aboriginal silence. The choir had ceased to sing. The hoofs of our
      horses, the dreadful rattle of our harness, the groaning of our wheels,
      alarmed the graves no more. By horror the bas-relief had been unlocked
      unto life. By horror we, that were so full of life, we men and our horses,
      with their fiery fore-legs rising in mid air to their everlasting gallop,
      were frozen to a bas-relief. Then a third time the trumpet sounded; the
      seals were taken off all pulses; life, and the frenzy of life, tore into
      their channels again; again the choir burst forth in sunny grandeur, as
      from the muffling of storms and darkness; again the thunderings of our
      horses carried temptation into the graves. One cry burst from our lips, as
      the clouds, drawing off from the aisle, showed it empty before us.&mdash;"Whither
      has the infant fled?&mdash;is the young child caught up to God?" Lo! afar
      off, in a vast recess, rose three mighty windows to the clouds; and on a
      level with their summits, at height insuperable to man, rose an altar of
      purest alabaster. On its eastern face was trembling a crimson glory. A
      glory was it from the reddening dawn that now streamed <i>through</i> the
      windows? Was it from the crimson robes of the martyrs painted <i>on</i>
      the windows? Was it from the bloody bas-reliefs of earth? There, suddenly,
      within that crimson radiance, rose the apparition of a woman's head, and
      then of a woman's figure. The child it was&mdash;grown up to woman's
      height. Clinging to the horns of the altar, voiceless she stood&mdash;sinking,
      rising, raving, despairing; and behind the volume of incense that, night
      and day, streamed upwards from the altar, dimly was seen the fiery font,
      and the shadow of that dreadful being who should have baptized her with
      the baptism of death. But by her side was kneeling her better angel, that
      hid his face with wings; that wept and pleaded for <i>her</i>; that prayed
      when <i>she</i> could <i>not</i>; that fought with Heaven by tears for <i>her</i>
      deliverance; which also, as he raised his immortal countenance from his
      wings, I saw, by the glory in his eye, that from Heaven he had won at
      last.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      Then was completed the passion of the mighty fugue. The golden tubes of
      the organ, which as yet had but muttered at intervals&mdash;gleaming
      amongst clouds and surges of incense&mdash;threw up, as from fountains
      unfathomable, columns of heart-shattering music. Choir and anti-choir were
      filling fast with unknown voices. Thou also, Dying Trumpeter, with thy
      love that was victorious, and thy anguish that was finishing, didst enter
      the tumult; trumpet and echo&mdash;farewell love, and farewell anguish&mdash;rang
      through the dreadful <i>sanctus</i>. Oh, darkness of the grave! that from
      the crimson altar and from the fiery font wert visited and searched by the
      effulgence in the angel's eye&mdash;were these indeed thy children? Pomps
      of life, that, from the burials of centuries, rose again to the voice of
      perfect joy, did ye indeed mingle with the festivals of Death? Lo! as I
      looked back for seventy leagues through the mighty cathedral, I saw the
      quick and the dead that sang together to God, together that sang to the
      generations of man. All the hosts of jubilation, like armies that ride in
      pursuit, moved with one step. Us, that, with laurelled heads, were passing
      from the cathedral, they overtook, and, as with a garment, they wrapped us
      round with thunders greater than our own. As brothers we moved together;
      to the dawn that advanced, to the stars that fled; rendering thanks to God
      in the highest&mdash;that, having hid His face through one generation
      behind thick clouds of War, once again was ascending, from the Campo Santo
      of Waterloo was ascending, in the visions of Peace; rendering thanks for
      thee, young girl! whom having overshadowed with His ineffable passion of
      death, suddenly did God relent, suffered thy angel to turn aside His arm,
      and even in thee, sister unknown! shown to me for a moment only to be
      hidden for ever, found an occasion to glorify His goodness. A thousand
      times, amongst the phantoms of sleep, have I seen thee entering the gates
      of the golden dawn, with the secret word riding before thee, with the
      armies of the grave behind thee,&mdash;seen thee sinking, rising, raving,
      despairing; a thousand times in the worlds of sleep have I seen thee
      followed by God's angel through storms, through desert seas, through the
      darkness of quicksands, through dreams and the dreadful revelations that
      are in dreams; only that at the last, with one sling of His victorious
      arm, He might snatch thee back from ruin, and might emblazon in thy
      deliverance the endless resurrections of His love!

    <h2>
      JOAN OF ARC
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: "<i>Arc</i>":&mdash;Modern France, that should know a great
      deal better than myself, insists that the name is not D'Arc&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
      of Arc&mdash;but <i>Darc</i>. Now it happens sometimes that, if a person
      whose position guarantees his access to the best information will content
      himself with gloomy dogmatism, striking the table with his fist, and
      saying in a terrific voice, "It <i>is</i> so, and there's an end of it,"
      one bows deferentially, and submits. But, if, unhappily for himself, won
      by this docility, he relents too amiably into reasons and arguments,
      probably one raises an insurrection against him that may never be crushed;
      for in the fields of logic one can skirmish, perhaps, as well as he. Had
      he confined himself to dogmatism, he would have intrenched his position in
      darkness, and have hidden his own vulnerable points. But coming down to
      base reasons he lets in light, and one sees where to plant the blows. Now,
      the worshipful reason of modern France for disturbing the old received
      spelling is that Jean Hordal, a descendant of La Pucelle's brother,
      spelled the name <i>Darc</i> in 1612. But what of that? It is notorious
      that what small matter of spelling Providence had thought fit to disburse
      amongst man in the seventeenth century was all monopolised by printers;
      now, M. Hordal was <i>not</i> a printer.]
    </p>
    <p>
      What is to be thought of <i>her</i>? What is to be thought of the poor
      shepherd girl from the hills and forests of Lorraine, that&mdash;like the
      Hebrew shepherd boy from the hills and forests of Judea&mdash;rose
      suddenly out of the quiet, out of the safety, out of the religious
      inspiration, rooted in deep pastoral solitudes, to a station in the van of
      armies, and to the more perilous station at the right hand of kings? The
      Hebrew boy inaugurated his patriotic mission by an <i>act</i>, by a
      victorious <i>act</i>, such as no man could deny. But so did the girl of
      Lorraine, if we read her story as it was read by those who saw her
      nearest. Adverse armies bore witness to the boy as no pretender; but so
      they did to the gentle girl. Judged by the voices of all who saw them <i>from
      a station of good will</i>, both were found true and loyal to any promises
      involved in their first acts. Enemies it was that made the difference
      between their subsequent fortunes. The boy rose to a splendour and a
      noonday prosperity, both personal and public, that rang through the
      records of his people, and became a byword among his posterity for a
      thousand years, until the sceptre was departing from Judah. The poor,
      forsaken girl, on the contrary, drank not herself from that cup of rest
      which she had secured for France. She never sang together with the songs
      that rose in her native Domrémy as echoes to the departing steps of
      invaders. She mingled not in the festal dances at Vaucouleurs which
      celebrated in rapture the redemption of France. No! for her voice was then
      silent; no! for her feet were dust. Pure, innocent, noble-hearted girl!
      whom, from earliest youth, ever I believed in as full of truth and
      self-sacrifice, this was amongst the strongest pledges for <i>thy</i>
      truth, that never once&mdash;no, not for a moment of weakness&mdash;didst
      thou revel in the vision of coronets and honour from man. Coronets for
      thee! Oh, no! Honours, if they come when all is over, are for those that
      share thy blood. [Footnote: "<i>Those that share thy blood</i>":&mdash;A
      collateral relative of Joanna's was subsequently ennobled by the title of
      <i>Du Lys</i>.] Daughter of Domrémy, when the gratitude of thy king shall
      awaken, thou wilt be sleeping the sleep of the dead. Call her, King of
      France, but she will not hear thee. Cite her by the apparitors to come and
      receive a robe of honour, but she will be found <i>en contumace</i>. When
      the thunders of universal France, as even yet may happen, shall proclaim
      the grandeur of the poor shepherd girl that gave up all for her country,
      thy ear, young shepherd girl, will have been deaf for five centuries. To
      suffer and to do, that was thy portion in this life; that was thy destiny;
      and not for a moment was it hidden from thyself. Life, thou saidst, is
      short; and the sleep which is in the grave is long; let me use that life,
      so transitory, for the glory of those heavenly dreams destined to comfort
      the sleep which is so long! This pure creature&mdash;pure from every
      suspicion of even a visionary self-interest, even as she was pure in
      senses more obvious&mdash;never once did this holy child, as regarded
      herself, relax from her belief in the darkness that was travelling to meet
      her. She might not prefigure the very manner of her death; she saw not in
      vision, perhaps, the aerial altitude of the fiery scaffold, the spectators
      without end, on every road, pouring into Rouen as to a coronation, the
      surging smoke, the volleying flames, the hostile faces all around, the
      pitying eye that lurked but here and there, until nature and imperishable
      truth broke loose from artificial restraints&mdash;these might not be
      apparent through the mists of the hurrying future. But the voice that
      called her to death, <i>that</i> she heard for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great was the throne of France even in those days, and great was He that
      sat upon it; but well Joanna knew that not the throne, nor he that sat
      upon it, was for <i>her</i>; but, on the contrary, that she was for <i>them</i>;
      not she by them, but they by her, should rise from the dust. Gorgeous were
      the lilies of France, and for centuries had the privilege to spread their
      beauty over land and sea, until, in another century, the wrath of God and
      man combined to wither them; but well Joanna knew, early at Domrémy she
      had read that bitter truth, that the lilies of France would decorate no
      garland for <i>her</i>. Flower nor bud, bell nor blossom, would ever bloom
      for <i>her</i>!

    <p>
      But stay. What reason is there for taking up this subject of Joanna
      precisely in the spring of 1847? Might it not have been left till the
      spring of 1947, or, perhaps, left till called for? Yes, but it <i>is</i>
      called for, and clamorously. You are aware, reader, that amongst the many
      original thinkers whom modern France has produced, one of the reputed
      leaders is M. Michelet. All these writers are of a revolutionary cast; not
      in a political sense merely, but in all senses; mad, oftentimes, as March
      hares; crazy with the laughing gas of recovered liberty; drunk with the
      wine cup of their mighty Revolution, snorting, whinnying, throwing up
      their heels, like wild horses in the boundless pampas, and running races
      of defiance with snipes, or with the winds, or with their own shadows, if
      they can find nothing else to challenge. Some time or other, I, that have
      leisure to read, may introduce <i>you</i>, that have not, to two or three
      dozen of these writers; of whom I can assure you beforehand that they are
      often profound, and at intervals are even as impassioned as if they were
      come of our best English blood. But now, confining our attention to M.
      Michelet, we in England&mdash;who know him best by his worst book, the
      book against priests, etc.&mdash;know him disadvantageously. That book is
      a rhapsody of incoherence. But his "History of France" is quite another
      thing. A man, in whatsoever craft he sails, cannot stretch away out of
      sight when he is linked to the windings of the shore by towing-ropes of
      History. Facts, and the consequences of facts, draw the writer back to the
      falconer's lure from the giddiest heights of speculation. Here, therefore&mdash;in
      his "France"&mdash;if not always free from flightiness, if now and then
      off like a rocket for an airy wheel in the clouds, M. Michelet, with
      natural politeness, never forgets that he has left a large audience
      waiting for him on earth, and gazing upward in anxiety for his return;
      return, therefore, he does. But History, though clear of certain
      temptations in one direction, has separate dangers of its own. It is
      impossible so to write a history of France, or of England&mdash;works
      becoming every hour more indispensable to the inevitably political man of
      this day&mdash;without perilous openings for error. If I, for instance, on
      the part of England, should happen to turn my labours into that channel,
      and (on the model of Lord Percy going to Chevy Chase)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "A vow to God should make
  My pleasure in the Michelet woods
  Three summer days to take,"
</pre>
    <p>
      probably, from simple delirium, I might hunt M. Michelet into <i>delirium
      tremens</i>. Two strong angels stand by the side of History, whether
      French history or English, as heraldic supporters: the angel of research
      on the left hand, that must read millions of dusty parchments, and of
      pages blotted with lies; the angel of meditation on the right hand, that
      must cleanse these lying records with fire, even as of old the draperies
      of <i>asbestos</i> were cleansed, and must quicken them into regenerated
      life. Willingly I acknowledge that no man will ever avoid innumerable
      errors of detail; with so vast a compass of ground to traverse, this is
      impossible; but such errors (though I have a bushel on hand, at M.
      Michelet's service) are not the game I chase; it is the bitter and unfair
      spirit in which M. Michelet writes against England. Even <i>that</i>,
      after all, is but my secondary object; the real one is Joanna, the Pucelle
      d'Orléans herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not going to write the history of La Pucelle: to do this, or even
      circumstantially to report the history of her persecution and bitter
      death, of her struggle with false witnesses and with ensnaring judges, it
      would be necessary to have before us <i>all</i> the documents, and
      therefore the collection only now forthcoming in Paris. [Footnote: "<i>Only
      now forthcoming</i>":&mdash;In 1847 <i>began</i> the publication (from
      official records) of Joanna's trial. It was interrupted, I fear, by the
      convulsions of 1848; and whether even yet finished I do not know.] But <i>my</i>
      purpose is narrower. There have been great thinkers, disdaining the
      careless judgments of contemporaries, who have thrown themselves boldly on
      the judgment of a far posterity, that should have had time to review, to
      ponder, to compare. There have been great actors on the stage of tragic
      humanity that might, with the same depth of confidence, have appealed from
      the levity of compatriot friends&mdash;too heartless for the sublime
      interest of their story, and too impatient for the labour of sifting its
      perplexities&mdash;to the magnanimity and justice of enemies. To this
      class belongs the Maid of Arc. The ancient Romans were too faithful to the
      ideal of grandeur in themselves not to relent, after a generation or two,
      before the grandeur of Hannibal. Mithridates, a more doubtful person, yet,
      merely for the magic perseverance of his indomitable malice, won from the
      same Romans the only real honour that ever he received on earth. And we
      English have ever shown the same homage to stubborn enmity. To work
      unflinchingly for the ruin of England; to say through life, by word and by
      deed, <i>Delenda est Anglia Victrix</i>!&mdash;that one purpose of malice,
      faithfully pursued, has quartered some people upon our national funds of
      homage as by a perpetual annuity. Better than an inheritance of service
      rendered to England herself has sometimes proved the most insane hatred to
      England. Hyder Ali, even his son Tippoo, though so far inferior, and
      Napoleon, have all benefited by this disposition among ourselves to
      exaggerate the merit of diabolic enmity. Not one of these men was ever
      capable, in a solitary instance, of praising an enemy (what do you say to
      <i>that</i>, reader?); and yet in <i>their</i> behalf, we consent to
      forget, not their crimes only, but (which is worse) their hideous bigotry
      and anti-magnanimous egotism&mdash;for nationality it was not. Suffren,
      and some half dozen of other French nautical heroes, because rightly they
      did us all the mischief they could (which was really great), are names
      justly reverenced in England. On the same principle, La Pucelle d'Orléans,
      the victorious enemy of England, has been destined to receive her deepest
      commemoration from the magnanimous justice of Englishmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna, as we in England should call her, but according to her own
      statement, Jeanne (or, as M. Michelet asserts, Jean [Footnote: "<i>Jean</i>":&mdash;M.
      Michelet asserts that there was a mystical meaning at that era in calling
      a child <i>Jean</i>; it implied a secret commendation of a child, if not a
      dedication, to St. John the evangelist, the beloved disciple, the apostle
      of love and mysterious visions. But, really, as the name was so
      exceedingly common, few people will detect a mystery in calling a <i>boy</i>
      by the name of Jack, though it <i>does</i> seem mysterious to call a girl
      Jack. It may be less so in France, where a beautiful practice has always
      prevailed of giving a boy his mother's name&mdash;preceded and
      strengthened by a male name, as <i>Charles Anne</i>, <i>Victor Victoire</i>.
      In cases where a mother's memory has been unusually dear to a son, this
      vocal memento of her, locked into the circle of his own name, gives to it
      the tenderness of a testamentary relic, or a funeral ring. I presume,
      therefore, that La Pucelle must have borne the baptismal name of Jeanne
      Jean; the latter with no reference, perhaps, to so sublime a person as St.
      John, but simply to some relative.]) D'Arc was born at Domrémy, a village
      on the marches of Lorraine and Champagne, and dependent upon the town of
      Vaucouleurs. I have called her a Lorrainer, not simply because the word is
      prettier, but because Champagne too odiously reminds us English of what
      are for <i>us</i> imaginary wines&mdash;which, undoubtedly, La Pucelle
      tasted as rarely as we English: we English, because the champagne of
      London is chiefly grown in Devonshire; La Pucelle, because the champagne
      of Champagne never, by any chance, flowed into the fountain of Domrémy,
      from which only she drank. M. Michelet will have her to be a <i>Champenoise</i>,
      and for no better reason than that she "took after her father," who
      happened to be a <i>Champenois</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These disputes, however, turn on refinements too nice. Domrémy stood upon
      the frontiers, and, like other frontiers, produced a <i>mixed</i> race,
      representing the <i>cis</i> and the <i>trans</i>. A river (it is true)
      formed the boundary line at this point&mdash;the river Meuse; and <i>that</i>,
      in old days, might have divided the populations; but in these days it did
      not; there were bridges, there were ferries, and weddings crossed from the
      right bank to the left. Here lay two great roads, not so much for
      travellers that were few, as for armies that were too many by half. These
      two roads, one of which was the great highroad between France and Germany,
      <i>decussated</i> at this very point; which is a learned way of saying
      that they formed a St. Andrew's Cross, or letter X. I hope the compositor
      will choose a good large X; in which case the point of intersection, the
      <i>locus</i> of conflux and intersection for these four diverging arms,
      will finish the reader's geographical education, by showing him to a
      hair's-breadth where it was that Domrémy stood. These roads, so grandly
      situated, as great trunk arteries between two mighty realms,[Footnote: And
      reminding one of that inscription, so justly admired by Paul Richter,
      which a Russian Czarina placed on a guide-post near Moscow: <i>This is the
      road that leads to Constantinople.</i>] and haunted for ever by wars or
      rumours of wars, decussated (for anything I know to the contrary)
      absolutely under Joanna's bedroom window; one rolling away to the right,
      past M. D'Arc's old barn, and the other unaccountably preferring to sweep
      round that odious man's pig-sty to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      On whichever side of the border chance had thrown Joanna, the same love to
      France would have been nurtured. For it is a strange fact, noticed by M.
      Michelet and others, that the Dukes of Bar and Lorraine had for
      generations pursued the policy of eternal warfare with France on their own
      account, yet also of eternal amity and league with France in case anybody
      else presumed to attack her. Let peace settle upon France, and before long
      you might rely upon seeing the little vixen Lorraine flying at the throat
      of France. Let France be assailed by a formidable enemy, and instantly you
      saw a Duke of Lorraine insisting on having his own throat cut in support
      of France; which favour accordingly was cheerfully granted to him in three
      great successive battles: twice by the English, viz., at Crécy and
      Agincourt, once by the Sultan at Nicopolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sympathy with France during great eclipses, in those that during
      ordinary seasons were always teasing her with brawls and guerilla inroads,
      strengthened the natural piety to France of those that were confessedly
      the children of her own house. The outposts of France, as one may call the
      great frontier provinces, were of all localities the most devoted to the
      Fleurs de Lys. To witness, at any great crisis, the generous devotion to
      these lilies of the little fiery cousin that in gentler weather was for
      ever tilting at the breast of France, could not but fan the zeal of
      France's legitimate daughters; while to occupy a post of honour on the
      frontiers against an old hereditary enemy of France would naturally
      stimulate this zeal by a sentiment of martial pride, by a sense of danger
      always threatening, and of hatred always smouldering. That great
      four-headed road was a perpetual memento to patriotic ardour. To say "This
      way lies the road to Paris, and that other way to Aix-la-Chapelle; this to
      Prague, that to Vienna," nourished the warfare of the heart by daily
      ministrations of sense. The eye that watched for the gleams of lance or
      helmet from the hostile frontier, the ear that listened for the groaning
      of wheels, made the highroad itself, with its relations to centres so
      remote, into a manual of patriotic duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation, therefore, <i>locally</i>, of Joanna was full of profound
      suggestions to a heart that listened for the stealthy steps of change and
      fear that too surely were in motion. But, if the place were grand, the
      time, the burden of the time, was far more so. The air overhead in its
      upper chambers was <i>hurtling</i> with the obscure sound; was dark with
      sullen fermenting of storms that had been gathering for a hundred and
      thirty years. The battle of Agincourt in Joanna's childhood had reopened
      the wounds of France. Crécy and Poictiers, those withering overthrows for
      the chivalry of France, had, before Agincourt occurred, been tranquilised
      by more than half a century; but this resurrection of their trumpet wails
      made the whole series of battles and endless skirmishes take their
      stations as parts in one drama. The graves that had closed sixty years ago
      seemed to fly open in sympathy with a sorrow that echoed their own. The
      monarchy of France laboured in extremity, rocked and reeled like a ship
      fighting with the darkness of monsoons. The madness of the poor king
      (Charles VI), falling in at such a crisis, like the case of women
      labouring in child-birth during the storming of a city, trebled the
      awfulness of the time. Even the wild story of the incident which had
      immediately occasioned the explosion of this madness&mdash;the case of a
      man unknown, gloomy, and perhaps maniacal himself, coming out of a forest
      at noonday, laying his hand upon the bridle of the king's horse, checking
      him for a moment to say, "Oh, king, thou art betrayed," and then
      vanishing, no man knew whither, as he had appeared for no man knew what&mdash;fell
      in with the universal prostration of mind that laid France on her knees,
      as before the slow unweaving of some ancient prophetic doom. The famines,
      the extraordinary diseases, the insurrections of the peasantry up and down
      Europe&mdash;these were chords struck from the same mysterious harp; but
      these were transitory chords. There had been others of deeper and more
      ominous sound. The termination of the Crusades, the destruction of the
      Templars, the Papal interdicts, the tragedies caused or suffered by the
      house of Anjou, and by the Emperor&mdash;these were full of a more
      permanent significance. But, since then, the colossal figure of feudalism
      was seen standing, as it were on tiptoe, at Crécy, for flight from earth:
      that was a revolution unparalleled; yet <i>that</i> was a trifle by
      comparison with the more fearful revolutions that were mining below the
      Church. By her own internal schisms, by the abominable spectacle of a
      double Pope&mdash;so that no man, except through political bias, could
      even guess which was Heaven's vicegerent, and which the creature of Hell&mdash;the
      Church was rehearsing, as in still earlier forms she had already
      rehearsed, those vast rents in her foundations which no man should ever
      heal.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the loftiest peaks of the cloudland in the skies that to the
      scientific gazer first caught the colors of the <i>new</i> morning in
      advance. But the whole vast range alike of sweeping glooms overhead dwelt
      upon all meditative minds, even upon those that could not distinguish the
      tendencies nor decipher the forms. It was, therefore, not her own age
      alone, as affected by its immediate calamities, that lay with such weight
      upon Joanna's mind, but her own age as one section in a vast mysterious
      drama, unweaving through a century back, and drawing nearer continually to
      some dreadful crisis. Cataracts and rapids were heard roaring ahead; and
      signs were seen far back, by help of old men's memories, which answered
      secretly to signs now coming forward on the eye, even as locks answer to
      keys. It was not wonderful that in such a haunted solitude, with such a
      haunted heart, Joanna should see angelic visions, and hear angelic voices.
      These voices whispered to her for ever the duty, self-imposed, of
      delivering France. Five years she listened to these monitory voices with
      internal struggles. At length she could resist no longer. Doubt gave way;
      and she left her home for ever in order to present herself at the
      dauphin's court. The education of this poor girl was mean according to the
      present standard: was ineffably grand, according to a purer philosophic
      standard: and only not good for our age because for us it would be
      unattainable. She read nothing, for she could not read; but she had heard
      others read parts of the Roman martyrology. She wept in sympathy with the
      sad "Misereres" of the Romish Church; she rose to heaven with the glad
      triumphant "Te Deums" of Rome; she drew her comfort and her vital strength
      from the rites of the same Church. But, next after these spiritual
      advantages, she owed most to the advantages of her situation. The fountain
      of Domrémy was on the brink of a boundless forest; and it was haunted to
      that degree by fairies that the parish priest (<i>curé</i>) was obliged to
      read mass there once a year, in order to keep them in any decent bounds.
      Fairies are important, even in a statistical view: certain weeds mark
      poverty in the soil; fairies mark its solitude. As surely as the wolf
      retires before cities does the fairy sequester herself from the haunts of
      the licensed victualer. A village is too much for her nervous delicacy; at
      most, she can tolerate a distant view of a hamlet. We may judge,
      therefore, by the uneasiness and extra trouble which they gave to the
      parson, in what strength the fairies mustered at Domrémy, and, by a
      satisfactory consequence, how thinly sown with men and women must have
      been that region even in its inhabited spots. But the forests of Domrémy&mdash;those
      were the glories of the land: for in them abode mysterious powers and
      ancient secrets that towered into tragic strength. "Abbeys there were, and
      abbey windows"&mdash;"like Moorish temples of the Hindoos"&mdash;that
      exercised even princely power both in Lorraine and in the German Diets.
      These had their sweet bells that pierced the forests for many a league at
      matins or vespers, and each its own dreamy legend. Few enough, and
      scattered enough, were these abbeys, so as in no degree to disturb the
      deep solitude of the region; yet many enough to spread a network or awning
      of Christian sanctity over what else might have seemed a heathen
      wilderness. This sort of religious talisman being secured, a man the most
      afraid of ghosts (like myself, suppose, or the reader) becomes armed into
      courage to wander for days in their sylvan recesses. The mountains of the
      Vosges, on the eastern frontier of France, have never attracted much
      notice from Europe, except in 1813-14 for a few brief months, when they
      fell within Napoleon's line of defence against the Allies. But they are
      interesting for this among other features, that they do not, like some
      loftier ranges, repel woods; the forests and the hills are on sociable
      terms. "Live and let live" is their motto. For this reason, in part, these
      tracts in Lorraine were a favourite hunting-ground with the Carlovingian
      princes. About six hundred years before Joanna's childhood, Charlemagne
      was known to have hunted there. That, of itself, was a grand incident in
      the traditions of a forest or a chase. In these vast forests, also, were
      to be found (if anywhere to be found) those mysterious fawns that tempted
      solitary hunters into visionary and perilous pursuits. Here was seen (if
      anywhere seen) that ancient stag who was already nine hundred years old,
      but possibly a hundred or two more, when met by Charlemagne; and the thing
      was put beyond doubt by the inscription upon his golden collar. I believe
      Charlemagne knighted the stag; and, if ever he is met again by a king, he
      ought to be made an earl, or, being upon the marches of France, a marquis.
      Observe, I don't absolutely vouch for all these things: my own opinion
      varies. On a fine breezy forenoon I am audaciously sceptical; but as
      twilight sets in my credulity grows steadily, till it becomes equal to
      anything that could be desired. And I have heard candid sportsmen declare
      that, outside of these very forests, they laughed loudly at all the dim
      tales connected with their haunted solitudes, but, on reaching a spot
      notoriously eighteen miles deep within them, they agreed with Sir Roger de
      Coverley that a good deal might be said on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such traditions, or any others that (like the stag) connect distant
      generations with each other, are, for that cause, sublime; and the sense
      of the shadowy, connected with such appearances that reveal themselves or
      not according to circumstances, leaves a colouring of sanctity over
      ancient forests, even in those minds that utterly reject the legend as a
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, apart from all distinct stories of that order, in any solitary
      frontier between two great empires&mdash;as here, for instance, or in the
      desert between Syria and the Euphrates&mdash;there is an inevitable
      tendency, in minds of any deep sensibility, to people the solitudes with
      phantom images of powers that were of old so vast. Joanna, therefore, in
      her quiet occupation of a shepherdess, would be led continually to brood
      over the political condition of her country by the traditions of the past
      no less than by the mementoes of the local present.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Michelet, indeed, says that La Pucelle was not a shepherdess. I beg his
      pardon; she was. What he rests upon I guess pretty well: it is the
      evidence of a woman called Haumette, the most confidential friend of
      Joanna. Now, she is a good witness, and a good girl, and I like her; for
      she makes a natural and affectionate report of Joanna's ordinary life. But
      still, however good she may be as a witness, Joanna is better; and she,
      when speaking to the dauphin, calls herself in the Latin report <i>Bergereta</i>.
      Even Haumette confesses that Joanna tended sheep in her girlhood. And I
      believe that, if Miss Haumette were taking coffee along with me this very
      evening (February 12, 1847)&mdash;in which there would be no subject for
      scandal or for maiden blushes, because I am an intense philosopher, and
      Miss H. would be hard upon 450 years old&mdash;she would admit the
      following comment upon her evidence to be right. A Frenchman, about forty
      years ago&mdash;M. Simond, in his "Travels"&mdash;mentions accidentally
      the following hideous scene as one steadily observed and watched by
      himself in chivalrous France not very long before the French Revolution: A
      peasant was plowing; and the team that drew his plow was a donkey and a
      woman. Both were regularly harnessed; both pulled alike. This is bad
      enough; but the Frenchman adds that, in distributing his lashes, the
      peasant was obviously desirous of being impartial; or, if either of the
      yokefellows had a right to complain, certainly it was not the donkey. Now,
      in any country where such degradation of females could be tolerated by the
      state of manners, a woman of delicacy would shrink from acknowledging,
      either for herself or her friend, that she had ever been addicted to any
      mode of labour not strictly domestic; because, if once owning herself a
      prædial servant, she would be sensible that this confession extended by
      probability in the hearer's thoughts to the having incurred indignities of
      this horrible kind. Haumette clearly thinks it more dignified for Joanna
      to have been darning the stockings of her horny-hoofed father, M. D'Arc,
      than keeping sheep, lest she might then be suspected of having ever done
      something worse. But, luckily, there was no danger of <i>that</i>: Joanna
      never was in service; and my opinion is that her father should have mended
      his own stockings, since probably he was the party to make the holes in
      them, as many a better man than D'Arc does&mdash;meaning by <i>that</i>
      not myself, because, though probably a better man than D'Arc, I protest
      against doing anything of the kind. If I lived even with Friday in Juan
      Fernandez, either Friday must do all the darning, or else it must go
      undone. The better men that I meant were the sailors in the British navy,
      every man of whom mends his own stockings. Who else is to do it? Do you
      suppose, reader, that the junior lords of the admiralty are under articles
      to darn for the navy?
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason, meantime, for my systematic hatred of D'Arc is this: There was
      a story current in France before the Revolution, framed to ridicule the
      pauper aristocracy, who happened to have long pedigrees and short rent
      rolls: viz., that a head of such a house, dating from the Crusades, was
      overheard saying to his son, a Chevalier of St. Louis, "<i>Chevalier,
      as-tu donné au cochon à manger</i>?" Now, it is clearly made out by the
      surviving evidence that D'Arc would much have preferred continuing to say,
      "<i>Ma fille, as-tu donné au cochon à manger</i>?" to saying, "<i>Pucelle
      d'Orléans, as-tu sauvé les fleurs-de-lys</i>?" There is an old English
      copy of verses which argues thus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "If the man that turnips cries
  Cry not when his father dies,
  Then 'tis plain the man had rather
  Have a turnip than his father."
</pre>
    <p>
      I cannot say that the logic of these verses was ever <i>entirely</i> to my
      satisfaction. I do not see my way through it as clearly as could be
      wished. But I see my way most clearly through D'Arc; and the result is&mdash;that
      he would greatly have preferred not merely a turnip to his father, but the
      saving a pound or so of bacon to saving the Oriflamme of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probable (as M. Michelet suggests) that the title of Virgin or
      Pucelle had in itself, and apart from the miraculous stories about her, a
      secret power over the rude soldiery and partisan chiefs of that period;
      for in such a person they saw a representative manifestation of the Virgin
      Mary, who, in a course of centuries, had grown steadily upon the popular
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Joanna's supernatural detection of the dauphin (Charles VII) among
      three hundred lords and knights, I am surprised at the credulity which
      could ever lend itself to that theatrical juggle. Who admires more than
      myself the sublime enthusiasm, the rapturous faith in herself, of this
      pure creature? But I am far from admiring stage artifices which not La
      Pucelle, but the court, must have arranged; nor can surrender myself to
      the conjurer's legerdemain, such as may be seen every day for a shilling.
      Southey's "Joan of Arc" was published in 1796. Twenty years after, talking
      with Southey, I was surprised to find him still owning a secret bias in
      favor of Joan, founded on her detection of the dauphin. The story, for the
      benefit of the reader new to the case, was this: La Pucelle was first made
      known to the dauphin, and presented to his court, at Chinon; and here came
      her first trial. By way of testing her supernatural pretensions, she was
      to find out the royal personage amongst the whole ark of clean and unclean
      creatures. Failing in this <i>coup d'essai</i>, she would not simply
      disappoint many a beating heart in the glittering crowd that on different
      motives yearned for her success, but she would ruin herself, and, as the
      oracle within had told her, would, by ruining herself, ruin France. Our
      own Sovereign Lady Victoria rehearses annually a trial not so severe in
      degree, but the same in kind. She "pricks" for sheriffs. Joanna pricked
      for a king. But observe the difference: our own Lady pricks for two men
      out of three; Joanna for one man out of three hundred. Happy Lady of the
      Islands and the Orient!&mdash;she <i>can</i> go astray in her choice only
      by one-half: to the extent of one-half she <i>must</i> have the
      satisfaction of being right. And yet, even with these tight limits to the
      misery of a boundless discretion, permit me, Liege Lady, with all loyalty,
      to submit that now and then you prick with your pin the wrong man. But the
      poor child from Domremy, shrinking under the gaze of a dazzling court&mdash;not
      <i>because</i> dazzling (for in visions she had seen those that were more
      so), but because some of them wore a scoffing smile on their features&mdash;how
      should <i>she</i> throw her line into so deep a river to angle for a king,
      where many a gay creature was sporting that masqueraded as kings in dress!
      Nay, even more than any true king would have done: for, in Southey's
      version of the story, the dauphin says, by way of trying the virgin's
      magnetic sympathy with royalty,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "On the throne,
  I the while mingling with the menial throng,
  Some courtier shall be seated."
</pre>
    <p>
      This usurper is even crowned: "the jeweled crown shines on a menial's
      head." But, really, that is "<i>un peu fort</i>"; and the mob of
      spectators might raise a scruple whether our friend the jackdaw upon the
      throne, and the dauphin himself, were not grazing the shins of treason.
      For the dauphin could not lend more than belonged to him. According to the
      popular notion, he had no crown for himself; consequently none to lend, on
      any pretence whatever, until the consecrated Maid should take him to
      Rheims. This was the <i>popular</i> notion in France. But certainly it was
      the dauphin's interest to support the popular notion, as he meant to use
      the services of Joanna. For if he were king already, what was it that she
      could do for him beyond Orleans? That is to say, what more than a merely
      <i>military</i> service could she render him? And, above all, if he were
      king without a coronation, and without the oil from the sacred ampulla,
      what advantage was yet open to him by celerity above his competitor, the
      English boy? Now was to be a race for a coronation: he that should win <i>that</i>
      race carried the superstition of France along with him: he that should
      first be drawn from the ovens of Rheims was under that superstition baked
      into a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Pucelle, before she could be allowed to practise as a warrior, was put
      through her manual and platoon exercise, as a pupil in divinity, at the
      bar of six eminent men in wigs. According to Southey (v. 393, bk. iii., in
      the original edition of his "Joan of Arc,") she "appalled the doctors."
      It's not easy to do <i>that</i>: but they had some reason to feel
      bothered, as that surgeon would assuredly feel bothered who, upon
      proceeding to dissect a subject, should find the subject retaliating as a
      dissector upon himself, especially if Joanna ever made the speech to them
      which occupies v. 354-391, bk. iii. It is a double impossibility: 1st,
      because a piracy from Tindal's "Christianity as old as the Creation"&mdash;a
      piracy <i>a parte ante</i>, and by three centuries; 2d, it is quite
      contrary to the evidence on Joanna's trial. Southey's "Joan" of A.D. 1796
      (Cottle, Bristol) tells the doctors, among other secrets, that she never
      in her life attended&mdash;1st, Mass; nor 2d, the Sacramental Table; nor
      3d, Confession. In the meantime, all this deistical confession of
      Joanna's, besides being suicidal for the interest of her cause, is opposed
      to the depositions upon <i>both</i> trials. The very best witness called
      from first to last deposes that Joanna attended these rites of her Church
      even too often; was taxed with doing so; and, by blushing, owned the
      charge as a fact, though certainly not as a fault. Joanna was a girl of
      natural piety, that saw God in forests and hills and fountains, but did
      not the less seek him in chapels and consecrated oratories.
    </p>
    <p>
      This peasant girl was self-educated through her own natural
      meditativeness. If the reader turns to that divine passage in "Paradise
      Regained" which Milton has put into the mouth of our Saviour when first
      entering the wilderness, and musing upon the tendency of those great
      impulses growing within himself&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Oh, what a multitude of thoughts at once
  Awakened in me swarm, while I consider
  What from within I feel myself, and hear
  What from without comes often to my ears,
  Ill sorting with my present state compared!
  When I was yet a child, no childish play
  To me was pleasing; all my mind was set
  Serious to learn and know, and thence to do,
  What might be public good; myself I thought
  Born to that end&mdash;&mdash;"
</pre>
    <p>
      he will have some notion of the vast reveries which brooded over the heart
      of Joanna in early girlhood, when the wings were budding that should carry
      her from Orleans to Rheims; when the golden chariot was dimly revealing
      itself that should carry her from the kingdom of <i>France Delivered</i>
      to the Eternal Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not requisite for the honour of Joanna, nor is there in this place
      room, to pursue her brief career of <i>action.</i> That, though wonderful,
      forms the earthly part of her story; the spiritual part is the saintly
      passion of her imprisonment, trial, and execution. It is unfortunate,
      therefore, for Southey's "Joan of Arc" (which, however, should always be
      regarded as a <i>juvenile</i> effort), that precisely when her real glory
      begins the poem ends. But this limitation of the interest grew, no doubt,
      from the constraint inseparably attached to the law of epic unity.
      Joanna's history bisects into two opposite hemispheres, and both could not
      have been presented to the eye in one poem, unless by sacrificing all
      unity of theme, or else by involving the earlier half, as a narrative
      episode, in the latter; which, however, might have been done, for it might
      have been communicated to a fellow-prisoner, or a confessor, by Joanna
      herself. It is sufficient, as concerns <i>this</i> section of Joanna's
      life, to say that she fulfilled, to the height of her promises, the
      restoration of the prostrate throne. France had become a province of
      England, and for the ruin of both, if such a yoke could be maintained.
      Dreadful pecuniary exhaustion caused the English energy to droop; and that
      critical opening La Pucelle used with a corresponding felicity of audacity
      and suddenness (that were in themselves portentous) for introducing the
      wedge of French native resources, for rekindling the national pride, and
      for planting the dauphin once more upon his feet. When Joanna appeared, he
      had been on the point of giving up the struggle with the English,
      distressed as they were, and of flying to the south of France. She taught
      him to blush for such abject counsels. She liberated Orleans, that great
      city, so decisive by its fate for the issue of the war, and then
      beleaguered by the English with an elaborate application of engineering
      skill unprecedented in Europe. Entering the city after sunset on the 29th
      of April, she sang mass on Sunday, May 8th, for the entire disappearance
      of the besieging force. On the 29th of June she fought and gained over the
      English the decisive battle of Patay; on the 9th of July she took Troyes
      by a <i>coup-de-main</i> from a mixed garrison of English and Burgundians;
      on the 15th of that month she carried the dauphin into Rheims; on Sunday
      the 17th she crowned him; and there she rested from her labour of triumph.
      All that was to be <i>done</i> she had now accomplished; what remained was&mdash;to
      <i>suffer</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this forward movement was her own; excepting one man, the whole
      council was against her. Her enemies were all that drew power from earth.
      Her supporters were her own strong enthusiasm, and the headlong contagion
      by which she carried this sublime frenzy into the hearts of women, of
      soldiers, and of all who lived by labour. Henceforward she was thwarted;
      and the worst error that she committed was to lend the sanction of her
      presence to counsels which she had ceased to approve. But she had now
      accomplished the capital objects which her own visions had dictated. These
      involved all the rest. Errors were now less important; and doubtless it
      had now become more difficult for herself to pronounce authentically what
      <i>were</i> errors. The noble girl had achieved, as by a rapture of
      motion, the capital end of clearing out a free space around her sovereign,
      giving him the power to move his arms with effect, and, secondly, the
      inappreciable end of winning for that sovereign what seemed to all France
      the heavenly ratification of his rights, by crowning him with the ancient
      solemnities. She had made it impossible for the English now to step before
      her. They were caught in an irretrievable blunder, owing partly to discord
      among the uncles of Henry VI, partly to a want of funds, but partly to the
      very impossibility which they believed to press with tenfold force upon
      any French attempt to forestall theirs. They laughed at such a thought;
      and, while they laughed, <i>she</i> did it. Henceforth the single redress
      for the English of this capital oversight, but which never <i>could</i>
      have redressed it effectually, was to vitiate and taint the coronation of
      Charles VII as the work of a witch. That policy, and not malice (as M.
      Michelet is so happy to believe), was the moving principle in the
      subsequent prosecution of Joanna. Unless they unhinged the force of the
      first coronation in the popular mind by associating it with power given
      from hell, they felt that the sceptre of the invader was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she, the child that, at nineteen, had wrought wonders so great for
      France, was she not elated? Did she not lose, as men so often <i>have</i>
      lost, all sobriety of mind when standing upon the pinnacle of success so
      giddy? Let her enemies declare. During the progress of her movement, and
      in the centre of ferocious struggles, she had manifested the temper of her
      feelings by the pity which she had everywhere expressed for the suffering
      enemy. She forwarded to the English leaders a touching invitation to unite
      with the French, as brothers, in a common crusade against infidels&mdash;thus
      opening the road for a soldierly retreat. She interposed to protect the
      captive or the wounded; she mourned over the excesses of her countrymen;
      she threw herself off her horse to kneel by the dying English soldier, and
      to comfort him with such ministrations, physical or spiritual, as his
      situation allowed. "Nolebat," says the evidence, "uti ense suo, aut
      quemquam interficere." She sheltered the English that invoked her aid in
      her own quarters. She wept as she beheld, stretched on the field of
      battle, so many brave enemies that had died without confession. And, as
      regarded herself, her elation expressed itself thus: on the day when she
      had finished her work, she wept; for she knew that, when her <i>triumphal</i>
      task was done, her end must be approaching. Her aspirations pointed only
      to a place which seemed to her more than usually full of natural piety, as
      one in which it would give her pleasure to die. And she uttered, between
      smiles and tears, as a wish that inexpressibly fascinated her heart, and
      yet was half fantastic, a broken prayer that God would return her to the
      solitudes from which he had drawn her, and suffer her to become a
      shepherdess once more. It was a natural prayer, because nature has laid a
      necessity upon every human heart to seek for rest and to shrink from
      torment. Yet, again, it was a half-fantastic prayer, because, from
      childhood upward, visions that she had no power to mistrust, and the
      voices which sounded in her ear for ever, had long since persuaded her
      mind that for <i>her</i> no such prayer could be granted. Too well she
      felt that her mission must be worked out to the end, and that the end was
      now at hand. All went wrong from this time. She herself had created the <i>funds</i>
      out of which the French restoration should grow; but she was not suffered
      to witness their development or their prosperous application. More than
      one military plan was entered upon which she did not approve. But she
      still continued to expose her person as before. Severe wounds had not
      taught her caution. And at length, in a sortie from Compiègne (whether
      through treacherous collusion on the part of her own friends is doubtful
      to this day), she was made prisoner by the Burgundians, and finally
      surrendered to the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now came her trial. This trial, moving of course under English influence,
      was conducted in chief by the Bishop of Beauvais. He was a Frenchman, sold
      to English interests, and hoping, by favour of the English leaders, to
      reach the highest preferment. "Bishop that art, Archbishop that shalt be,
      Cardinal that mayest be," were the words that sounded continually in his
      ear; and doubtless a whisper of visions still higher, of a triple crown,
      and feet upon the necks of kings, sometimes stole into his heart. M.
      Michelet is anxious to keep us in mind that this bishop was but an agent
      of the English. True. But it does not better the case for his countryman
      that, being an accomplice in the crime, making himself the leader in the
      persecution against the helpless girl, he was willing to be all this in
      the spirit, and with the conscious vileness of a cat's-paw. Never from the
      foundations of the earth was there such a trial as this, if it were laid
      open in all its beauty of defence and all its hellishness of attack. Oh,
      child of France! shepherdess, peasant girl! trodden under foot by all
      around thee, how I honour thy flashing intellect, quick as God's
      lightning, and true as God's lightning to its mark, that ran before France
      and laggard Europe by many a century, confounding the malice of the
      ensnarer, and making dumb the oracles of falsehood! Is it not scandalous,
      is it not humiliating to civilization, that, even at this day, France
      exhibits the horrid spectacle of judges examining the prisoner against
      himself; seducing him, by fraud, into treacherous conclusions against his
      own head; using the terrors of their power for extorting confessions from
      the frailty of hope; nay (which is worse), using the blandishments of
      condescension and snaky kindness for thawing into compliances of gratitude
      those whom they had failed to freeze into terror? Wicked judges! barbarian
      jurisprudence!&mdash;that, sitting in your own conceit on the summits of
      social wisdom, have yet failed to learn the first principles of criminal
      justice&mdash;sit ye humbly and with docility at the feet of this girl
      from Domrémy, that tore your webs of cruelty into shreds and dust. "Would
      you examine me as a witness against myself?" was the question by which
      many times she defied their arts. Continually she showed that their
      interrogations were irrelevant to any business before the court, or that
      entered into the ridiculous charges against her. General questions were
      proposed to her on points of casuistical divinity; two-edged questions,
      which not one of themselves could have answered, without, on the one side,
      landing himself in heresy (as then interpreted), or, on the other, in some
      presumptuous expression of self-esteem. Next came a wretched Dominican,
      that pressed her with an objection, which, if applied to the Bible, would
      tax every one of its miracles with unsoundness. The monk had the excuse of
      never having read the Bible. M. Michelet has no such excuse; and it makes
      one blush for him, as a philosopher, to find him describing such an
      argument as "weighty," whereas it is but a varied expression of rude
      Mahometan metaphysics. Her answer to this, if there were room to place the
      whole in a clear light, was as shattering as it was rapid. Another thought
      to entrap her by asking what language the angelic visitors of her solitude
      had talked&mdash;as though heavenly counsels could want polyglot
      interpreters for every word, or that God needed language at all in
      whispering thoughts to a human heart. Then came a worse devil, who asked
      her whether the Archangel Michael had appeared naked. Not comprehending
      the vile insinuation, Joanna, whose poverty suggested to her simplicity
      that it might be the <i>costliness</i> of suitable robes which caused the
      demur, asked them if they fancied God, who clothed the flowers of the
      valleys, unable to find raiment for his servants. The answer of Joanna
      moves a smile of tenderness, but the disappointment of her judges makes
      one laugh exultingly. Others succeeded by troops, who upbraided her with
      leaving her father; as if that greater Father, whom she believed herself
      to have been serving, did not retain the power of dispensing with his own
      rules, or had not said that for a less cause than martyrdom man and woman
      should leave both father and mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Easter Sunday, when the trial had been long proceeding, the poor girl
      fell so ill as to cause a belief that she had been poisoned. It was not
      poison. Nobody had any interest in hastening a death so certain. M.
      Michelet, whose sympathies with all feelings are so quick that one would
      gladly see them always as justly directed, reads the case most truly.
      Joanna had a twofold malady. She was visited by a paroxysm of the
      complaint called <i>homesickness</i>. The cruel nature of her
      imprisonment, and its length, could not but point her solitary thoughts,
      in darkness and in chains (for chained she was), to Domrémy. And the
      season, which was the most heavenly period of the spring, added stings to
      this yearning. That was one of her maladies&mdash;<i>nostalgia</i>, as
      medicine calls it; the other was weariness and exhaustion from daily
      combats with malice. She saw that everybody hated her and thirsted for her
      blood; nay, many kind-hearted creatures that would have pitied her
      profoundly, as regarded all political charges, had their natural feelings
      warped by the belief that she had dealings with fiendish powers. She knew
      she was to die; that was <i>not</i> the misery! the misery was that this
      consummation could not be reached without so much intermediate strife, as
      if she were contending for some chance (where chance was none) of
      happiness, or were dreaming for a moment of escaping the inevitable. Why,
      then, <i>did</i> she contend? Knowing that she would reap nothing from
      answering her persecutors, why did she not retire by silence from the
      superfluous contest? It was because her quick and eager loyalty to truth
      would not suffer her to see it darkened by frauds which <i>she</i> could
      expose, but others, even of candid listeners, perhaps, could not; it was
      through that imperishable grandeur of soul which taught her to submit
      meekly and without a struggle to her punishment, but taught her <i>not</i>
      to submit&mdash;no, not for a moment&mdash;to calumny as to facts, or to
      misconstruction as to motives. Besides, there were secretaries all around
      the court taking down her words. That was meant for no good to <i>her</i>.
      But the end does not always correspond to the meaning. And Joanna might
      say to herself, "These words that will be used against me to-morrow and
      the next day, perhaps, in some nobler generation, may rise again for my
      justification." Yes, Joanna, they <i>are</i> rising even now in Paris, and
      for more than justification!
    </p>
    <p>
      Woman, sister, there are some things which you do not execute as well as
      your brother, man; no, nor ever will. Pardon me if I doubt whether you
      will ever produce a great poet from your choirs, or a Mozart, or a
      Phidias, or a Michael Angelo, or a great philosopher, or a great scholar.
      By which last is meant&mdash;not one who depends simply on an infinite
      memory, but also on an infinite and electrical power of combination;
      bringing together from the four winds, like the angel of the resurrection,
      what else were dust from dead men's bones, into the unity of breathing
      life. If you <i>can</i> create yourselves into any of these great
      creators, why have you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, sister woman, though I cannot consent to find a Mozart or a Michael
      Angelo in your sex, cheerfully, and with the love that burns in depths of
      admiration, I acknowledge that you can do one thing as well as the best of
      us men&mdash;a greater thing than even Milton is known to have done, or
      Michael Angelo; you can die grandly, and as goddesses would die, were
      goddesses mortal. If any distant worlds (which <i>may</i> be the case) are
      so far ahead of us Tellurians in optical resources as to see distinctly
      through their telescopes all that we do on earth, what is the grandest
      sight to which we ever treat them? St. Peter's at Rome, do you fancy, on
      Easter Sunday, or Luxor, or perhaps the Himalayas? Oh, no! my friend;
      suggest something better; these are baubles to <i>them</i>; they see in
      other worlds, in their own, far better toys of the same kind. These, take
      my word for it, are nothing. Do you give it up? The finest thing, then, we
      have to show them is a scaffold on the morning of execution. I assure you
      there is a strong muster in those far telescopic worlds, on any such
      morning, of those who happen to find themselves occupying the right
      hemisphere for a peep at <i>us</i>. How, then, if it be announced in some
      such telescopic world by those who make a livelihood of catching glimpses
      at our newspapers, whose language they have long since deciphered, that
      the poor victim in the morning's sacrifice is a woman? How, if it be
      published in that distant world that the sufferer wears upon her head, in
      the eyes of many, the garlands of martyrdom? How, if it should be some
      Marie Antoinette, the widowed queen, coming forward on the scaffold, and
      presenting to the morning air her head, turned gray by sorrow&mdash;daughter
      of Caesars kneeling down humbly to kiss the guillotine, as one that
      worships death? How, if it were the noble Charlotte Corday, that in the
      bloom of youth, that with the loveliest of persons, that with homage
      waiting upon her smiles wherever she turned her face to scatter them&mdash;homage
      that followed those smiles as surely as the carols of birds, after showers
      in spring, follow the reappearing sun and the racing of sunbeams over the
      hills&mdash;yet thought all these things cheaper than the dust upon her
      sandals, in comparison of deliverance from hell for her dear suffering
      France! Ah! these were spectacles indeed for those sympathising people in
      distant worlds; and some, perhaps, would suffer a sort of martyrdom
      themselves, because they could not testify their wrath, could not bear
      witness to the strength of love and to the fury of hatred that burned
      within them at such scenes, could not gather into golden urns some of that
      glorious dust which rested in the catacombs of earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Wednesday after Trinity Sunday in 1431, being then about nineteen
      years of age, the Maid of Arc underwent her martyrdom. She was conducted
      before mid-day, guarded by eight hundred spearmen, to a platform of
      prodigious height, constructed of wooden billets supported by occasional
      walls of lath and plaster, and traversed by hollow spaces in every
      direction for the creation of air currents. The pile "struck terror," says
      M. Michelet, "by its height"; and, as usual, the English purpose in this
      is viewed as one of pure malignity. But there are two ways of explaining
      all that. It is probable that the purpose was merciful. On the
      circumstances of the execution I shall not linger. Yet, to mark the almost
      fatal felicity of M. Michelet in finding out whatever may injure the
      English name, at a moment when every reader will be interested in Joanna's
      personal appearance, it is really edifying to notice the ingenuity by
      which he draws into light from a dark corner a very unjust account of it,
      and neglects, though lying upon the highroad, a very pleasing one. Both
      are from English pens. Grafton, a chronicler, but little read, being a
      stiff-necked John Bull, thought fit to say that no wonder Joanna should be
      a virgin, since her "foule face" was a satisfactory solution of that
      particular merit. Holinshead, on the other hand, a chronicler somewhat
      later, every way more important, and at one time universally read, has
      given a very pleasing testimony to the interesting character of Joanna's
      person and engaging manners. Neither of these men lived till the following
      century, so that personally this evidence is none at all. Grafton sullenly
      and carelessly believed as he wished to believe; Holinshead took pains to
      inquire, and reports undoubtedly the general impression of France. But I
      cite the case as illustrating M. Michelet's candour. [Footnote: Amongst
      the many ebullitions of M. Michelet's fury against us poor English are
      four which will be likely to amuse the reader; and they are the more
      conspicuous in collision with the justice which he sometimes does us, and
      the very indignant admiration which, under some aspects, he grants to us.
      1. Our English literature he admires with some gnashing of teeth. He
      pronounces it "fine and sombre," but, I lament to add, "skeptical, Judaic,
      Satanic&mdash;in a word, antichristian." That Lord Byron should figure as
      a member of this diabolical corporation will not surprise men. It <i>will</i>
      surprise them to hear that Milton is one of its Satanic leaders. Many are
      the generous and eloquent Frenchmen, besides Chateaubriand, who have, in
      the course of the last thirty years, nobly suspended their own burning
      nationality, in order to render a more rapturous homage at the feet of
      Milton; and some of them have raised Milton almost to a level with angelic
      natures. Not one of them has thought of looking for him <i>below</i> the
      earth. As to Shakspere, M. Michelet detects in him a most extraordinary
      mare's nest. It is this: he does "not recollect to have seen the name of
      God" in any part of his works. On reading such words, it is natural to rub
      one's eyes, and suspect that all one has ever seen in this world may have
      been a pure ocular delusion. In particular, I begin myself to suspect that
      the word "<i>la gloire</i>" never occurs in any Parisian journal. "The
      great English nation," says M. Michelet, "has one immense profound vice"&mdash;to
      wit, "pride." Why, really, that may be true; but we have a neighbour not
      absolutely clear of an "immense profound vice," as like ours in colour and
      shape as cherry to cherry. In short, M. Michelet thinks us, by fits and
      starts, admirable&mdash;only that we are detestable; and he would adore
      some of our authors, were it not that so intensely he could have wished to
      kick them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. M. Michelet thinks to lodge an arrow in our sides by a very odd remark
      upon Thomas à Kempis: which is, that a man of any conceivable European
      blood&mdash;a Finlander, suppose, or a Zantiote&mdash;might have written
      Tom; only not an Englishman. Whether an Englishman could have forged Tom
      must remain a matter of doubt, unless the thing had been tried long ago.
      That problem was intercepted for ever by Tom's perverseness in choosing to
      manufacture himself. Yet, since nobody is better aware than M. Michelet
      that this very point of Kempis <i>having</i> manufactured Kempis is
      furiously and hopelessly litigated, three or four nations claiming to have
      forged his work for him, the shocking old doubt will raise its snaky head
      once more&mdash;whether this forger, who rests in so much darkness, might
      not, after all, be of English blood. Tom, it may be feared, is known to
      modern English literature chiefly by an irreverent mention of his name in
      a line of Peter Pindar's (Dr Wolcot) fifty years back, where he is
      described as

        "Kempis Tom,
  Who clearly shows the way to Kingdom Come"

      Few in these days can have read him, unless in the Methodist version of
      John Wesley Among those few, however, happens to be myself, which arose
      from the accident of having, when a boy of eleven, received a copy of the
      "De Imitatione Christi" as a bequest from a relation who died very young,
      from which cause, and from the external prettiness of the book&mdash;being
      a Glasgow reprint by the celebrated Foulis, and gaily bound&mdash;I was
      induced to look into it, and finally read it many times over, partly out
      of some sympathy which, even in those days, I had with its simplicity and
      devotional fervour, but much more from the savage delight I found in
      laughing at Tom's Latinity that, I freely grant to M Michelet, is
      inimitable. Yet, after all, it is not certain whether the original <i>was</i>
      Latin. But, however that may have been, if it is possible that M Michelet
      [Footnote: "<i>If M. Michelet can be accurate</i>"&mdash;However, on
      consideration, this statement does not depend on Michelet. The
      bibliographer Barbier has absolutely <i>specified</i> sixty in a separate
      dissertation, <i>soixante traductions</i> among those even that have not
      escaped the search. The Italian translations are said to be thirty. As to
      mere editions, not counting the early MSS. for half a century before
      printing was introduced, those in Latin amount to 2000, and those in
      French to 1000. Meantime it is very clear to me that this astonishing
      popularity so entirely unparalleled in literature, could not have existed
      except in Roman Catholic times, nor subsequently have lingered in any
      Protestant land. It was the denial of Scripture fountains to thirsty lands
      which made this slender rill of Scripture truth so passionately welcome.]
      can be accurate in saying that there are no less than sixty French
      versions (not editions, observe, but separate versions) existing of the
      "De Imitatione," how prodigious must have been the adaptation of the book
      to the religious heart of the fifteenth century! Excepting the Bible, but
      excepting <i>that</i> only in Protestant lands, no book known to man has
      had the same distinction. It is the most marvellous bibliographical fact
      on record.
    </p>

      3. Our English girls, it seems, are as faulty in one way as we English
      males in another. None of us men could have written the <i>Opera Omnia</i>
      of Mr. à Kempis; neither could any of our girls have assumed male attire
      like La Pucelle. But why? Because, says Michelet, English girls and German
      think so much of an indecorum. Well, that is a good fault, generally
      speaking. But M. Michelet ought to have remembered a fact in the
      martyrologies which justifies both parties&mdash;the French heroine for
      doing, and the general choir of English girls for <i>not</i> doing. A
      female saint, specially renowned in France, had, for a reason as weighty
      as Joanna's&mdash;viz., expressly to shield her modesty among men&mdash;worn
      a male military harness. That reason and that example authorised La
      Pucelle; but our English girls, as a body, have seldom any such reason,
      and certainly no such saintly example, to plead. This excuses <i>them</i>.
      Yet, still, if it is indispensable to the national character that our
      young women should now and then trespass over the frontier of decorum, it
      then becomes a patriotic duty in me to assure M. Michelet that we <i>have</i>
      such ardent females among us, and in a long series; some detected in naval
      hospitals when too sick to remember their disguise; some on fields of
      battle; multitudes never detected at all; some only suspected; and others
      discharged without noise by war offices and other absurd people. In our
      navy, both royal and commercial, and generally from deep remembrances of
      slighted love, women have sometimes served in disguise for many years,
      taking contentedly their daily allowance of burgoo, biscuit, or
      cannon-balls&mdash;anything, in short, digestible or indigestible, that it
      might please Providence to send. One thing, at least, is to their credit:
      never any of these poor masks, with their deep silent remembrances, have
      been detected through murmuring, or what is nautically understood by
      "skulking." So, for once, M. Michelet has an <i>erratum</i> to enter upon
      the fly-leaf of his book in presentation copies.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. But the last of these ebullitions is the most lively. We English, at
      Orleans, and after Orleans (which is not quite so extraordinary, if all
      were told), fled before the Maid of Arc. Yes, says M. Michelet, you <i>did</i>:
      deny it, if you can. Deny it, <i>mon cher</i>? I don't mean to deny it.
      Running away, in many cases, is a thing so excellent that no philosopher
      would, at times, condescend to adopt any other step. All of us nations in
      Europe, without one exception, have shown our philosophy in that way at
      times. Even people "<i>qui ne se rendent pas</i>" have deigned both to run
      and to shout, "<i>Sauve qui peut</i>!" at odd times of sunset; though, for
      my part, I have no pleasure in recalling unpleasant remembrances to brave
      men; and yet, really, being so philosophic, they ought <i>not</i> to be
      unpleasant. But the amusing feature in M. Michelet's reproach is the way
      in which he <i>improves</i> and varies against us the charge of running,
      as if he were singing a catch. Listen to him: They "<i>showed their backs</i>"
      did these English. (Hip, hip, hurrah! three times three!) "<i>Behind good
      walls they let themselves be taken</i>." (Hip, hip! nine times nine!) They
      "<i>ran as fast as their legs could carry them</i>" (Hurrah! twenty-seven
      times twenty-seven!) They "<i>ran before a girl</i>"; they did. (Hurrah!
      eighty-one times eighty-one!) This reminds one of criminal indictments on
      the old model in English courts, where (for fear the prisoner should
      escape) the crown lawyer varied the charge perhaps through forty counts.
      The law laid its guns so as to rake the accused at every possible angle.
      While the indictment was reading, he seemed a monster of crime in his own
      eyes; and yet, after all, the poor fellow had but committed one offence,
      and not always <i>that</i>. N. B.&mdash;Not having the French original at
      hand, I make my quotations from a friend's copy of Mr. Walter Kelly's
      translation; which seems to me faithful, spirited, and idiomatically
      English&mdash;liable, in fact, only to the single reproach of occasional
      provincialisms.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstantial incidents of the execution, unless with more space than
      I can now command, I should be unwilling to relate. I should fear to
      injure, by imperfect report, a martyrdom which to myself appears so
      unspeakably grand. Yet, for a purpose, pointing not at Joanna, but at M.
      Michelet&mdash;viz, to convince him that an Englishman is capable of
      thinking more highly of La Pucelle than even her admiring countrymen&mdash;I
      shall, in parting, allude to one or two traits in Joanna's demeanour on
      the scaffold, and to one or two in that of the bystanders, which authorise
      me in questioning an opinion of his upon this martyr's firmness. The
      reader ought to be reminded that Joanna D'Arc was subjected to an
      unusually unfair trial of opinion. Any of the elder Christian martyrs had
      not much to fear of <i>personal</i> rancour. The martyr was chiefly
      regarded as the enemy of Cæsar; at times, also, where any knowledge of the
      Christian faith and morals existed, with the enmity that arises
      spontaneously in the worldly against the spiritual. But the martyr, though
      disloyal, was not supposed to be therefore anti-national; and still less
      was <i>individually</i> hateful. What was hated (if anything) belonged to
      his class, not to himself separately. Now, Joanna, if hated at all, was
      hated personally, and in Rouen on national grounds. Hence there would be a
      certainty of calumny arising against <i>her</i> such as would not affect
      martyrs in general. That being the case, it would follow of necessity that
      some people would impute to her a willingness to recant. No innocence
      could escape <i>that</i>. Now, had she really testified this willingness
      on the scaffold, it would have argued nothing at all but the weakness of a
      genial nature shrinking from the instant approach of torment. And those
      will often pity that weakness most who, in their own persons, would yield
      to it least. Meantime, there never was a calumny uttered that drew less
      support from the recorded circumstances. It rests upon no <i>positive</i>
      testimony, and it has a weight of contradicting testimony to stem. And
      yet, strange to say, M, Michelet, who at times seems to admire the Maid of
      Arc as much as I do, is the one sole writer among her <i>friends</i> who
      lends some countenance to this odious slander. His words are that, if she
      did not utter this word <i>recant</i> with her lips, she uttered it in her
      heart. "Whether she <i>said</i> the word is uncertain; but I affirm that
      she <i>thought</i> it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I affirm that she did not; not in any sense of the word "<i>thought</i>"
      applicable to the case. Here is France calumniating La Pucelle; here is
      England defending her. M. Michelet can only mean that, on <i>a priori</i>
      principles, every woman must be presumed liable to such a weakness; that
      Joanna was a woman; <i>ergo</i>, that she was liable to such a weakness.
      That is, he only supposes her to have uttered the word by an argument
      which presumes it impossible for anybody to have done otherwise. I, on the
      contrary, throw the onus of the argument not on presumable tendencies of
      nature, but on the known facts of that morning's execution, as recorded by
      multitudes. What else, I demand, than mere weight of metal, absolute
      nobility of deportment, broke the vast line of battle then arrayed against
      her? What else but her meek, saintly demeanour won, from the enemies that
      till now had believed her a witch, tears of rapturous admiration? "Ten
      thousand men," says M. Michelet himself&mdash;"ten thousand men wept"; and
      of these ten thousand the majority were political enemies knitted together
      by cords of superstition. What else was it but her constancy, united with
      her angelic gentleness, that drove the fanatic English soldier&mdash;who
      had sworn to throw a fagot on her scaffold as <i>his</i> tribute of
      abhorrence, that <i>did</i> so, that fulfilled his vow&mdash;suddenly to
      turn away a penitent for life, saying everywhere that he had seen a dove
      rising upon wings to heaven from the ashes where she had stood? What else
      drove the executioner to kneel at every shrine for pardon to <i>his</i>
      share in the tragedy? And, if all this were insufficient, then I cite the
      closing act of her life as valid on her behalf, were all other testimonies
      against her. The executioner had been directed to apply his torch from
      below. He did so. The fiery smoke rose upward in billowing volumes. A
      Dominican monk was then standing almost at her side. Wrapped up in his
      sublime office, he saw not the danger, but still persisted in his prayers.
      Even then, when the last enemy was racing up the fiery stairs to seize
      her, even at that moment did this noblest of girls think only for <i>him</i>,
      the one friend that would not forsake her, and not for herself; bidding
      him with her last breath to care for his own preservation, but to leave <i>her</i>
      to God. That girl, whose latest breath ascended in this sublime expression
      of self-oblivion, did not utter the word <i>recant</i> either with her
      lips or in her heart. No; she did not, though one should rise from the
      dead to swear it.

      Bishop of Beauvais! thy victim died in fire upon a scaffold&mdash;thou
      upon a down bed. But, for the departing minutes of life, both are
      oftentimes alike. At the farewell crisis, when the gates of death are
      opening, and flesh is resting from its struggles, oftentimes the tortured
      and the torturer have the same truce from carnal torment; both sink
      together into sleep; together both sometimes kindle into dreams. When the
      mortal mists were gathering fast upon you two, bishop and shepherd girl&mdash;when
      the pavilions of life were closing up their shadowy curtains about you&mdash;let
      us try, through the gigantic glooms, to decipher the flying features of
      your separate visions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shepherd girl that had delivered France&mdash;she, from her dungeon,
      she, from her baiting at the stake, she, from her duel with fire, as she
      entered her last dream&mdash;saw Domrémy, saw the fountain of Domrémy, saw
      the pomp of forests in which her childhood had wandered. That Easter
      festival which man had denied to her languishing heart&mdash;that
      resurrection of springtime, which the darkness of dungeons had intercepted
      from <i>her</i>, hungering after the glorious liberty of forests&mdash;were
      by God given back into her hands as jewels that had been stolen from her
      by robbers. With those, perhaps (for the minutes of dreams can stretch
      into ages), was given back to her by God the bliss of childhood. By
      special privilege for <i>her</i> might be created, in this farewell dream,
      a second childhood, innocent as the first; but not, like <i>that</i>, sad
      with the gloom of a fearful mission in the rear. This mission had now been
      fulfilled. The storm was weathered; the skirts even of that mighty storm
      were drawing off. The blood that she was to reckon for had been exacted;
      the tears that she was to shed in secret had been paid to the last. The
      hatred to herself in all eyes had been faced steadily, had been suffered,
      had been survived. And in her last fight upon the scaffold she had
      triumphed gloriously; victoriously she had tasted the stings of death. For
      all, except this comfort from her farewell dream, she had died&mdash;died
      amid the tears of ten thousand enemies&mdash;died amid the drums and
      trumpets of armies&mdash;died amid peals redoubling upon peals, volleys
      upon volleys, from the saluting clarions of martyrs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop of Beauvais! because the guilt-burdened man is in dreams haunted
      and waylaid by the most frightful of his crimes, and because upon that
      fluctuating mirror&mdash;rising (like the mocking mirrors of <i>mirage</i>
      in Arabian deserts) from the fens of death-most of all are reflected the
      sweet countenances which the man has laid in ruins; therefore I know,
      bishop, that you also, entering your final dream, saw Domrémy. That
      fountain, of which the witnesses spoke so much, showed itself to your eyes
      in pure morning dews; but neither dews, nor the holy dawn, could cleanse
      away the bright spots of innocent blood upon its surface. By the fountain,
      bishop, you saw a woman seated, that hid her face. But, as <i>you</i> draw
      near, the woman raises her wasted features. Would Domrémy know them again
      for the features of her child? Ah, but <i>you</i> know them, bishop, well!
      Oh, mercy! what a groan was <i>that</i> which the servants, waiting
      outside the bishop's dream at his bedside, heard from his labouring heart,
      as at this moment he turned away from the fountain and the woman, seeking
      rest in the forests afar off. Yet not <i>so</i> to escape the woman, whom
      once again he must behold before he dies. In the forests to which he prays
      for pity, will he find a respite? What a tumult, what a gathering of feet
      is there! In glades where only wild deer should run armies and nations are
      assembling; towering in the fluctuating crowd are phantoms that belong to
      departed hours. There is the great English Prince, Regent of France. There
      is my Lord of Winchester, the princely cardinal, that died and made no
      sign. There is the bishop of Beauvais, clinging to the shelter of
      thickets. What building is that which hands so rapid are raising? Is it a
      martyr's scaffold? Will they burn the child of Domrémy a second time? No;
      it is a tribunal that rises to the clouds; and two nations stand around
      it, waiting for a trial. Shall my Lord of Beauvais sit again upon the
      judgment-seat, and again number the hours for the innocent? Ah, no! he is
      the prisoner at the bar. Already all is waiting: the mighty audience is
      gathered, the Court is hurrying to their seats, the witnesses are arrayed,
      the trumpets are sounding, the judge is taking his place. Oh, but this is
      sudden! My lord, have you no counsel? "Counsel I have none; in heaven
      above, or on earth beneath, counsellor there is none now that would take a
      brief from <i>me</i>: all are silent." Is it, indeed, come to this? Alas!
      the time is short, the tumult is wondrous, the crowd stretches away into
      infinity; but yet I will search in it for somebody to take your brief; I
      know of somebody that will be your counsel. Who is this that cometh from
      Domrémy? Who is she in bloody coronation robes from Rheims? Who is she
      that cometh with blackened flesh from walking the furnaces of Rouen? This
      is she, the shepherd girl, counsellor that had none for herself, whom I
      choose, bishop, for yours. She it is, I engage, that shall take my lord's
      brief. She it is, bishop, that would plead for you; yes, bishop, <i>she</i>&mdash;when
      heaven and earth are silent.

    <h3>
      THE ENGLISH MAIL-COACH
    </h3>
    <p>
      "In October 1849 there appeared in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> an article
      entitled <i>The English Mail-Coach, or the Glory of Motion</i>. There was
      no intimation that it was to be continued; but in December 1849 there
      followed in the same magazine an article in two sections, headed by a
      paragraph explaining that it was by the author of the previous article in
      the October number, and was to be taken in connexion with that article.
      One of the sections of this second article was entitled <i>The Vision of
      Sudden Death</i>, and the other <i>Dream-Fugue on the above theme of
      Sudden Death</i>. When De Quincey revised the papers in 1854 for
      republication in volume iv of the Collective Edition of his writings, he
      brought the whole under the one general title of <i>The English Mail-Coach</i>,
      dividing the text, as at present, into three sections or chapters, the
      first with the sub-title <i>The Glory of Motion</i>, the second with the
      sub-title <i>The Vision of Sudden Death</i>, and the third with the
      sub-title <i>Dream-Fugue, founded on the preceding theme of Sudden Death</i>.
      Great care was bestowed on the revision. Passages that had appeared in the
      magazine articles were omitted; new sentences were inserted; and the
      language was retouched throughout."&mdash;MASSON. Cf. as to the revision,
      Professor Dowden's article, "How De Quincey worked," <i>Saturday Review</i>,
      Feb. 23, 1895. This selection is found in <i>Works</i>, Masson's ed., Vol.
      XIII, pp. 270-327; Riverside ed., Vol. I, pp. 517-582.

    <p>
      1 6 HE HAD MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A DUKE: "Mr. John Palmer, a native of
      Bath, and from about 1768 the energetic proprietor of the Theatre Royal in
      that city, had been led, by the wretched state in those days of the means
      of intercommunication between Bath and London, wand his own consequent
      difficulties in arranging for a punctual succession of good actors at his
      theatre, to turn his attention to the improvement of the whole system of
      Post-Office conveyance, and of locomotive machinery generally, in the
      British Islands. The result was a scheme for superseding, on the great
      roads at least, the then existing system of sluggish and irregular
      stage-coaches, the property of private persons and companies, by a new
      system of government coaches, in connexion with the Post-Office, carrying
      the mails and also a regulated number of passengers, with clockwork
      precision, at a rate of comparative speed, which he hoped should
      ultimately be not less than ten miles an hour. The opposition to the
      scheme was, of course, enormous; coach proprietors, innkeepers, the
      Post-Office officials themselves, were all against Mr. Palmer; he was
      voted a crazy enthusiast and a public bore. Pitt, however, when the scheme
      was submitted to him, recognized its feasibility; on the 8th of August
      1784 the first mail-coach on Mr. Palmer's plan started from London at 8
      o'clock in the morning and reached Bristol at 11 o'clock at night; and
      from that day the success of the new system was assured.&mdash;Mr. Palmer
      himself, having been appointed Surveyor and Comptroller-General of the
      Post-Office, took rank as an eminent and wealthy public man, M. P. for
      Bath and what not, and lived till 1818. De Quincey makes it one of his
      distinctions that he "had married the daughter of a duke," and in a
      footnote to that paragraph he gives the lady's name as "Lady Madeline
      Gordon." From an old Debrett, however, I learn that Lady Madelina Gordon,
      second daughter of Alexander, fourth Duke of Gordon, was first married, on
      the 3d of April 1789, to Sir Robert Sinclair, Bart., and next, on the 25th
      of November 1805, to <i>Charles Palmer, of Lockley Park, Berks, Esq.</i>
      If Debrett is right, her second husband was not John Palmer of Mail-Coach
      celebrity, and De Quincey is wrong."&mdash;MASSON.

      3 13 THE FOUR TERMS OF MICHAELMAS, LENT, EASTER, AND ACT: These might be
      called respectively the autumn, winter, spring, and summer terms.
      Michaelmas, the feast of St. Michael and All Angels, is on September 29.
      Hilary and Trinity are other names for Lent term and Act term
      respectively. Act term is the last term of the academic year; its name is
      that originally given to a disputation for a Master's degree; such
      disputations took place at the end of the year generally, and hence gave a
      name to the summer term. Although the rules concerning residence at Oxford
      are more stringent than in De Quincey's time, only eighteen weeks'
      residence is required during the year, six in Michaelmas, six in Lent, and
      six in Easter and Act.

      3 17 GOING DOWN: Cf. "Going down with victory," i.e. from London into the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      3 30 POSTING-HOUSES: inns where relays of horses were furnished for
      coaches and carriages. Cf. De Quincey on <i>Travelling, loc. cit.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      4 3 AN OLD TRADITION... from the reign of Charles II: Then no one sat
      outside; later, outside places were taken by servants, and were quite
      cheap.
    </p>
    <p>
      4 9 ATTAINT THE FOOT: The word is used in its legal sense. The blood of
      one convicted of high treason is "attaint," and his deprivations extend to
      his descendants, unless Parliament remove the attainder.
    </p>
    <p>
      4 14 PARIAHS: The fate of social outcasts seems to have taken early and
      strong hold upon De Quincey's mind; one of the <i>Suspiria</i> was to have
      enlarged upon this theme. Strictly speaking, the Pariahs is that one of
      the lower castes of Hindoo society of which foreigners have seen most; it
      is not in all districts the lowest caste, however.

      existentibus eadem est lex</i>, a Roman legal phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      5 16 "SNOBS": Apparently snob originally meant "shoemaker"; then, in
      university cant, a "townsman" as opposed to a "gownsman." Cf. <i>Gradus ad
      Cantabrigiam</i> (1824), quoted in <i>Century Dictionary</i>: "<i>Snobs</i>.&mdash;A
      term applied indiscriminately to all who have not the honour of being
      members of the university; but in a more particular manner to the
      'profanum vulgus,' the tag-rag and bob-tail, who vegetate on the sedgy
      banks of Camus." This use is in De Quincey's mind. Later, in the strikes
      of that time, the workmen who accepted lower wages were called <i>snobs</i>;
      those who held out for higher, <i>nobs</i>.

      7 33 FO FO... FI FI: "This paragraph is a caricature of a story told in
      Staunton's Account of the Earl of Macartney's Embassy to China in 1792."&mdash;MASSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      8 4 ÇA IRA ("This will do," "This is the go"): "a proverb of the French
      Revolutionists when they were hanging the aristocrats in the streets,
      &amp;c., and the burden of one of the most popular revolutionary songs,
      'Ça ira, ça ira, ça ira.'"&mdash;MASSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      8 18 ALL MORALITY,&mdash;ARISTOTLE'S, ZENO'S, CICERO'S: Each of these
      three has a high place in the history of ethical teaching. Aristotle wrote
      the so-called <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>. According to his teaching,
      "ethical virtue is that permanent direction of the will which guards the
      mean [<i>to méson</i>] proper for us... Bravery is the mean between
      cowardice and temerity; temperance, the mean between inordinate desire and
      stupid indifference; etc." (Ueberweg, <i>History of Philosophy</i>, Vol.
      I, p. 169). Zeno, who died about 264 B.C., founded about 308 the Stoic
      sect, which took its name from the "Painted Porch" (<i>Stoa poklae</i>) in
      the Agora at Athens, where the master taught. The Stoics held that men
      should be free from passion, and undisturbed by joy or grief, submitting
      themselves uncomplainingly to their fate. Such austere views are, of
      course, as far as possible removed from those of the Eudæmonist, who
      sought happiness as the end of life. Cicero was the author of De Officiis,
      "Of Duties."

      undertaken in the year 1772, by Uno Von Troil, D.D., of Stockholm,
      contains no chapter of the kind. Such a chapter had appeared, however, in
      N. Horrebow's (Danish, 1758) Natural History of Iceland: "Chap. LXXII.
      Concerning snakes. No snakes of any kind are to be met with throughout the
      whole island." In Boswell's Johnson, Vol. IV, p. 314, Temple ed., there is
      a much more correct allusion, which may have been in De Quincey's mind:
      "Langton said very well to me afterwards, that he could repeat Johnson's
      conversation before dinner, as Johnson had said that he could repeat a
      complete chapter of The Natural History of Iceland, from the Danish of
      Horrebow, the whole of which was exactly thus: 'Chap. LXXII. Concerning
      Snakes. There are no snakes to be met with throughout the whole island.'"

      12 26 FALSE ECHOES OF MARENGO: General Desaix was shot through the heart
      at the battle of Marengo (June 14, 1800); he died without a word, and his
      body was found by Rovigo (cf. Memoirs of the Duke of Rovigo, London, 1835,
      Vol. I, p. 181), "stripped of his clothes, and surrounded by other naked
      bodies." Napoleon, however, published three different versions of an
      heroic and devoted message from Desaix to himself, the original version
      being: "Go, tell the First Consul that I die with this regret,&mdash;that
      I have not done enough for posterity." (Cf. Lanfrey, History of Napoleon
      the First, 2d ed., London, 1886, Vol. II, p. 39.) Napoleon himself was
      credited likewise with the words De Quincey adopts. "Why is it not
      permitted me to weep" is one version (Bussey, <i>History of Napoleon</i>,
      London, 1840, Vol. I, p. 302). Cf. Hazlitt, <i>Life of Napoleon</i>, 2d
      ed., London, 1852, Vol. II, p. 317, footnote.

      12 (footnote) THE CRY OF THE FOUNDERING LINE-OF-BATTLE SHIP "VENGEUR": On
      the 1st of June, 1794, the English fleet under Lord Howe defeated the
      French under Villaret-Joyeuse, taking six ships and sinking a seventh, the
      <i>Vengeur</i>. This ship sank, as a matter of fact, with part of her crew
      on board, imploring kid which there was not time to give them. Some two
      hundred and fifty men had been taken off by the English; the rest were
      lost. On the 9th of July Barrere published a report setting forth "how the
      <i>Vengeur</i>, ... being entirely disabled, ... refused to strike, though
      sinking; how the enemies fired on her, but she returned their fire, shot
      aloft all her tricolor streamers, shouted <i>Vive la République</i>, ...
      and so, in this mad whirlwind of fire and shouting and invincible despair,
      went down into the ocean depths; <i>Vive la République</i> and a universal
      volley from the upper deck being the last sounds she made." Cf. Carlyle,

      original edition, Vol. III, p. 253 (new edition, Social England
      Illustrated, pp. 28-29), where, after telling how Henry the Seventh,
      perceiving that four mastiffs could overcome a lion, ordered the dogs all
      hanged, the writer continues: "I read an history answerable to this, of
      the selfsame HENRY, who having a notable and an excellent fair falcon, it
      fortuned that the King's Falconers, in the presence and hearing of his
      Grace, highly commended his Majesty's Falcon, saying, that it feared not
      to intermeddle with an eagle, it was so venturous and so mighty a bird;
      which when the king heard, he charged that the falcon should be killed
      without delay: for the selfsame reason, as it may seem, which was
      rehearsed in the conclusion of the former history concerning the same

      was passed. Skeat explains <i>torets</i> as "probably eyes in which rings
      will turn round, because each eye is a little larger than the thickness of
      the ring." Cf. Chaucer's <i>Treatise on the Astrolabe</i>, Part I, sec. 2,
      "This ring renneth in a maner turet," "this ring runs in a kind of eye."
      But Chaucer does not refer to harness.

      named to distinguish it from St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, which faces what
      is now Trafalgar Square, and is, as the name indicates, outside the

      30 17 FEY: This is not a Celtic word; it is the Anglo-Saxon <i>faege</i>
      retained in Lowland Scotch, which is the most northerly English dialect.
      The word appears frequently in descriptions of battles, the Anglo-Saxon
      fatalistic philosophy teaching that, certain warriors entered the conflict
      <i>faege</i>, "doomed." Now the meaning is altered slightly: "You are
      surely fey," would be said in Scotland, as Professor Masson remarks, to a
      person observed to be in extravagantly high spirits, or in any mood
      surprisingly beyond the bounds of his ordinary temperament,&mdash;the
      notion being that the excitement is supernatural, and a presage of his
      approaching death, or of some other calamity about to befall him.

      31 27 THE INSPIRATION OF GOD, ETC.: This is an indication&mdash;more

    <p>
      33 13 CÆSAR THE DICTATOR, AT HIS LAST DINNER-PARTY, ETC.: related by
      Suetonius in his life of Julius Cæsar, Chap. LXXXVII: "The day before he
      died, some discourse occurring at dinner in M. Lepidus' house upon that
      subject, which was the most agreeable way of dying, he expressed his
      preference for what is sudden and unexpected" (repentinum inopinatumque
      praetulerat). The story is told by Plutarch and Appian also.
    </p>
    <p>
      35 13 <i>BIATHANATOS</i>: "De Quincey has evidently taken this from John
      Donne's treatise: <i>BIATHANATOS, A Declaration of that Paradoxe or
      Thesis, That Self-homicide is not so naturally Sin, that it may never be
      otherwise</i>, 1644. See his paper on <i>Suicide, etc.</i>, Masson's ed.,
      VIII, 398 [Riverside, IX, 209]. But not even Donne's precedent justifies
      the word formation. The only acknowledged compounds are <i>biaio-thanasia</i>,
      'violent death,' and <i>biaio-thanatos</i>, 'dying a violent death.' Even
      <i>bia thanatos</i>, 'death by violence,' is not classical."&mdash;HART.
      But the form <i>biathanatos</i> is older than Donne and is said to be
      common in MSS. It should be further remarked that neither of the two
      compounds cited is classical. As to De Quincey's interpretation of Cæsar's
      meaning here, cf. Merivale's <i>History of the Romans under the Empire</i>,
      Chap. XXI, where he translates Cæsar's famous reply: "That which is least
      expected." Cf. also Shakespeare, <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, Act II, sc. ii, 1.

      38 2 SO SCENICAL, ETC.: De Quincey's love for effects of this sort appears

      40 12 UNDER THIS EMINENT MAN, ETC.: For these two sentences the original
      in <i>Blackwood</i> had this, with its addition of good De Quinceyan
      doctrine: "I used to call him <i>Cyclops Mastigophorus</i>, Cyclops the
      Whip-bearer, until I observed that his skill made whips useless, except to
      fetch off an impertinent fly from a leader's head, upon which I changed
      his Grecian name to <i>Cyclops Diphrelates</i> (Cyclops the Charioteer).
      I, and others known to me, studied under him the diphrelatic art. Excuse,
      reader, a word too elegant to be pedantic. And also take this remark from
      me as a <i>gage d'amitié</i>&mdash;that no word ever was or <i>can</i> be
      pedantic which, by supporting a distinction, supports the accuracy of
      logic, or which fills up a chasm for the understanding."

      43 2 SEVEN ATMOSPHERES OF SLEEP, ETC.: Professor Hart suggests that De
      Quincey is here "indulging in jocular arithmetic. The three nights plus
      the three days, plus the present night, equal seven." Dr. Cooper compares
      with this a reference to the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus. But it seems
      doubtful whether any explanation is necessary.

    </p>
    <p>
      52 1 FASTER THAN EVER MILL-RACE, ETC.: the change in the wording of this
      sentence in De Quincey's revision is, as Masson remarks, particularly
      characteristic of his sense of melody; it read in <i>Blackwood</i>, "We
      ran past them faster than ever mill-race in our inexorable flight."
    </p>
    <p>
      52 15 HERE WAS THE MAP, ETC.: This sentence is an addition in the reprint.
      Masson remarks "how artistically it causes the due pause between the

      when the crash was past."

      54 3 WOMAN'S IONIC FORM: In thus using the word Ionic, De Quincey
      doubtless has in mind the character of Ionic architecture, with its tall
      and graceful column, differing from the severity of the Doric on the one
      hand and from the floridity of the Corinthian on the other. Probably he is
      thinking of a caryatid. Cf. the following version of the old story of the
      origin of the styles of Greek architecture in Vitruvius, IV, Chap. I
      (Gwilt's translation), quoted by Hart: "They measured a man's foot, and
      finding its length the sixth part of his height, they gave the column a
      similar proportion, that is, they made its height six times the thickness
      of the shaft measured at the base. Thus the Doric order obtained its
      proportion, its strength, and its beauty from the human figure. With a
      similar feeling they afterward built the Temple of Diana. But in that,
      seeking a new proportion, they used the female figure as a standard; and
      for the purpose of producing a more lofty effect they first made it eight
      times its thickness in height. Under it they placed a base, after the
      manner of a shoe to the foot; they also added volutes to its capital, like
      graceful curling hair hanging on each side, and the front they ornamented
      with <i>cymatia</i> and festoons in the place of hair. On the shafts they
      sunk channels, which bear a resemblance to the folds of a matronal
      garment. Thus two orders were invented, one of a masculine character,
      without ornament, the other bearing a character which resembled the
      delicacy, ornament, and proportion of a female. The successors of these
      people, improving in taste, and preferring a more slender proportion,
      assigned seven diameters to the height of the Doric column, and eight and
      a half to the Ionic."

      63 29 THE ENDLESS RESURRECTIONS OF HIS LOVE: The following, which Masson

      volume of the Collective Edition containing this piece:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'THE ENGLISH MAIL-COACH.'&mdash;This little paper, according to my
      original intention, formed part of the 'Suspiria de Profundis'; from
      which, for a momentary purpose, I did not scruple to detach it, and to
      publish it apart, as sufficiently intelligible even when dislocated from
      its place in a larger whole. To my surprise, however, one or two critics,
      not carelessly in conversation, but deliberately in print, professed their
      inability to apprehend the meaning of the whole, or to follow the links of
      the connexion between its several parts. I am myself as little able to
      understand where the difficulty lies, or to detect any lurking obscurity,
      as these critics found themselves to unravel my logic. Possibly I may not
      be an indifferent and neutral judge in such a case. I will therefore
      sketch a brief abstract of the little paper according to my original
      design, and then leave the reader to judge how far this design is kept in
      sight through the actual execution.

      night, and of a night memorably solemn, the solitary witness of an
      appalling scene, which threatened instant death in a shape the most
      terrific to two young people whom I had no means of assisting, except in
      so far as I was able to give them a most hurried warning of their danger;
      but even <i>that</i> not until they stood within the very shadow of the
      catastrophe, being divided from the most frightful of deaths by scarcely
      more, if more at all, than seventy seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such was the scene, such in its outline, from which the whole of this
      paper radiates as a natural expansion. This scene is circumstantially
      narrated in Section the Second, entitled 'The Vision of Sudden Death.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a movement of horror, and of spontaneous recoil from this dreadful
      scene, naturally carried the whole of that scene, raised and idealised,
      into my dreams, and very soon into a rolling succession of dreams. The
      actual scene, as looked down upon from the box of the mail, was
      transformed into a dream, as tumultuous and changing as a musical fugue.
      This troubled dream is circumstantially reported in Section the Third,
      entitled 'Dream-Fugue on the theme of Sudden Death.' What I had beheld
      from my seat upon the mail,&mdash;the scenical strife of action and
      passion, of anguish and fear, as I had there witnessed them moving in
      ghostly silence,&mdash;this duel between life and death narrowing itself
      to a point of such exquisite evanescence as the collision neared; all
      these elements of the scene blended, under the law of association, with
      the previous and permanent features of distinction investing the mail
      itself; which features at that time lay&mdash;1st, in velocity
      unprecedented, 2dly, in the power and beauty of the horses, 3dly, in the
      official connexion with the government of a great nation, and, 4thly, in
      the function, almost a consecrated function, of publishing and diffusing
      through the land the great political events, and especially the great
      battles, during a conflict of unparalleled grandeur. These honorary
      distinctions are all described circumstantially in the First or
      introductory Section ('The Glory of Motion'). The three first were
      distinctions maintained at all times; but the fourth and grandest belonged
      exclusively to the war with Napoleon; and this it was which most naturally
      introduced Waterloo into the dream. Waterloo, I understand, was the
      particular feature of the 'Dream-Fugue' which my censors were least able
      to account for. Yet surely Waterloo, which, in common with every other
      great battle, it had been our special privilege to publish over all the
      land, most naturally entered the dream under the licence of our privilege.
      If not&mdash;if there be anything amiss&mdash;let the Dream be
      responsible. The Dream is a law to itself; and as well quarrel with a
      rainbow for showing, or for <i>not</i> showing, a secondary arch. So far
      as I know, every element in the shifting movements of the Dream derived
      itself either primarily from the incidents of the actual scene, or from
      secondary features associated with the mail. For example, the cathedral
      aisle derived itself from the mimic combination of features which grouped
      themselves together at the point of approaching collision&mdash;viz. an
      arrow-like section of the road, six hundred yards long, under the solemn
      lights described, with lofty trees meeting overhead in arches. The guard's
      horn, again&mdash;a humble instrument in itself&mdash;was yet glorified as
      the organ of publication for so many great national events. And the
      incident of the Dying Trumpeter, who rises from a marble bas-relief, and
      carries a marble trumpet to his marble lips for the purpose of warning the
      female infant, was doubtless secretly suggested by my own imperfect effort
      to seize the guard's horn, and to blow the warning blast. But the Dream
      knows best; and the Dream, I say again, is the responsible party."

      70 4 NATIONALITY IT WAS NOT: i.e. nationalism&mdash;patriotism&mdash;it
      was not. Cf. <i>Revolt of the Tartars</i>, Riverside ed., Vol. XII, p. 4;
      Masson's ed., Vol. VII, p. 370, where De Quincey speaks of the Torgod as
      "tribes whose native ferocity was exasperated by debasing forms of
      superstition, and by a nationality as well as an inflated conceit of their
      own merit absolutely unparalleled." Cf. also footnote, p. 94.

    <p>
      74 2 THE FAMINES, ETC.: Horrible famines occurred in France and England in
      1315, 1336, and 1353. Such insurrections as Wat Tyler's, in 1381, are
      probably in De Quincey's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      74 6 THE TERMINATION OF THE CRUSADES: The Crusades came to an end about
      1271. "The ulterior results of the crusades," concludes Cox in <i>Encyclopedia
      Britannica</i>, "were the breaking up of the feudal system, the abolition
      of serfdom, the supremacy of a common law over the independent
      jurisdiction of chiefs who claimed the right of private wars."
    </p>
    <p>
      74 7 THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLARS: This most famous of the military
      orders, founded in the twelfth century for the defense of the Latin
      kingdom of Jerusalem, having grown so powerful as to be greatly feared,
      was suppressed at the beginning of the fourteenth century.

    <p>
      74 7 THE PAPAL INTERDICTS: "De Quincey has probably in mind such an
      interdict as that pronounced in 1200, by Innocent III, against France. All
      ecclesiastical functions were suspended and the land was in desolation."&mdash;HART.
      England was put under interdict several times, as in 1170 (for the murder
      of Becket) and 1208.

    <p>
      74 8 THE TRAGEDIES CAUSED OR SUFFERED BY THE HOUSE OF ANJOU, AND BY THE
      EMPEROR: "The Emperor is Konradin, the last of the Hohenstaufen, beheaded
      by Charles of Anjou at Naples, 1268. The subsequent cruelties of Charles
      in Sicily caused the popular uprising known as the Sicilian Vespers, 1282,
      in which many thousands of Frenchmen were assassinated."&mdash;HART.
    </p>
    <p>
      74 10 THE COLOSSAL FIGURE OF FEUDALISM, ETC.: The English yeomen at Crecy,
      overpowering the mounted knights of France, took from feudalism its chief
      support,&mdash;the superiority of the mounted knight to the unmounted
      yeoman. Cf. Green, <i>History of the English People</i>, Book IV, Chap.

  And mosques, and spires, and abbey windows,

      76 17 THE VOSGES ... HAVE NEVER ATTRACTED MUCH NOTICE, ETC.: They came
      into like prominence after De Quincey's day in the Franco-Prussian War of
      1870.
    </p>
    <p>
      76 31 THOSE MYSTERIOUS FAWNS, ETC.: In some of the romances of the Middle
      Ages, especially those containing Celtic material, a knight, while
      hunting, is led by his pursuit of a white fawn (or a white stag or boar)
      to a <i>fee</i> (i.e. an inhabitant of the "Happy Other-world") or into
      the confines of the "Happy Other-world" itself. Sometimes, as in the <i>Guigemar</i>
      of Marie de France, the knight passes on to a series of adventures in
      consequence of his meeting with the white fawn. I owe this note to the
      kindness of Mr. S. W. Kinney, A.M., of Baltimore.
    </p>
    <p>
      76 33 THAT ANCIENT STAG: See <i>Englische Studien,</i> Vol. V, p. 16,
      where additions are made to the following account from Hardwicke's <i>Traditions,
      Superstitions, and Folk-Lore,</i> Manchester and London, 1872, p. 154:
    </p>
    <p>
      This chasing of the white doe or the white hart by the spectre huntsman
      has assumed various forms. According to Aristotle a white hart was killed
      by Agathocles, King of Sicily, which a thousand years beforehand had been
      consecrated to Diana by Diomedes. Alexander the Great is said by Pliny to
      have caught a white stag, placed a collar of gold about its neck, and
      afterwards set it free. Succeeding heroes have in after days been
      announced as the capturers of this famous white hart. Julius Caesar took
      the place of Alexander, and Charlemagne caught a white hart at both
      Magdeburg, and in the Holstein woods. In 1172 William [Henry] the Lion is
      reported to have accomplished a similar feat, according to a Latin
      inscription on the walls of Lubeck Cathedral. Tradition says the white
      hart has been caught on Rothwell Hay Common, in Yorkshire, and in Windsor
      Forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reference I owe indirectly to Professor J. M. Manly, of Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      77 4 OR, BEING UPON THE MARCHES OF FRANCE, A MARQUIS: <i>Marquis</i> is
      derived from <i>march,</i> and was originally the title of the guardian of
      the frontier, or march.
    </p>
    <p>
      77 13 AGREED WITH SIR ROGER DE COVERLEY THAT A GOOD DEAL MIGHT BE SAID ON
      BOTH SIDES: This expression, as has been pointed out to me, is from the
      middle of <i>Spectator</i> No. 122, where Sir Roger, having been appealed
      to on a question of fishing privileges, replied, "with an air of a man who
      would not give his judgment rashly, that much might be said on both
      sides." It is likely, however, that De Quincey may have connected it in
      his mind with the discussion of witchcraft at the beginning of <i>Spectator</i>
      No. 117, where Addison balances the grounds for belief and unbelief
      somewhat as De Quincey does here.
    </p>
    <p>
      78 7 BERGERETA: a very late Latin form of French <i>bergerette,</i> "a
      shepherdess."
    </p>
    <p>
      78 15 M. SIMOND, IN HIS "TRAVELS": The reference is to <i>Journal of a
      Tour and Residence in Great Britain during the years 1810 and 1811,</i> by
      Louis Simond, 2d ed. (Edinburgh, 1817), to which is added an appendix on
      France, written in December, 1815, and October, 1816. De Quincey refers to
      this story with horror several times, but such scenes are not yet wholly
      unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      79 21 A CHEVALIER OF ST. LOUIS: The French order of St. Louis was founded
      by Louis XIV in 1693 for military service. After its discontinuance at the
      Revolution this order was reinstated in 1814; but no knights have been
      created since 1830. "Chevalier" is the lowest rank in such an order; it is
      here erroneously used by De Quincey as a title of address.
    </p>
    <p>
      79 22 "CHEVALIER, AS-TU DONNÉ," etc.: "Chevalier, have you fed the hog?"
      "MA FILLE," ETC.: "My daughter, have you," etc. "PUCELLE," ETC.: "Maid of
      Orleans, have you saved the lilies (i.e. France)?"
    </p>
    <p>
      79 28 IF THE MAN THAT TURNIPS CRIES: Cf. <i>Johnsoniana</i>, ed. R.
      Napier, London, 1884, where, in <i>Anecdotes of Johnson</i>, by Mrs.
      Piozzi, p. 29, is found: "'T is a mere play of words (added he)"&mdash;Johnson
      is speaking of certain "verses by Lopez de Vega"&mdash;"and you might as
      well say, that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "If the man who turnips cries,
  Cry not when his father dies,
  'T is a proof that he had rather
  Have a turnip than his father."

    <p>
      80 22 TWENTY YEARS AFTER, TALKING WITH SOUTHEY: In 1816 De Quincey was a
      resident of Grasmere; Southey lived for many years at Keswick, a few miles
      away; they met first in 1807. For De Quincey's estimate of Southey's <i>Joan
      of Arc</i>, see <i>Works</i>, Riverside ed., Vol. VI, pp. 262-266;
      Masson's ed., Vol. V, pp. 238-242.

      82 26 TINDAL'S "CHRISTIANITY AS OLD AS THE CREATION": Matthew Tindal
      (1657-1732) published this work in 1732; its greatest interest lies in the
      fact that to this book more than to any other Butler's <i>Analogy</i> was
      a reply. Tindal's argument was that natural religion, as taught by the
      deists, was complete; that no revelation was necessary. A life according
      to nature is all that the best religion can teach. Such doctrine as this
      Joan preached in the speech ascribed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      82 27 A PARTE ANTE: "from the part gone before"; Joan's speech being three
      centuries earlier than the book from which it was taken.

      French officers of conniving at Joan's capture through jealousy of her
      successes. Compiègne is fifty miles northeast of Paris.

      87 27 BISHOP OF BEAUVAIS: Beauvais is forty-three miles northwest of
      Paris, in Normandy. This bishop, Pierre Cauchon, rector of the University
      at Paris, was devoted to the English party.

      a tall cap of golden cloth, encircled by three coronets.

    <p>
      88 17 JUDGES EXAMINING THE PRISONER: The judge in France questions a
      prisoner minutely when he is first taken, before he is remanded for trial.
      De Quincey displays here his inveterate prejudice against the French; but
      this practice is widely regarded as the vital error of French criminal
      procedure.,
    </p>
    <p>
      89 5 A WRETCHED DOMINICAN: a member of the order of mendicant friars
      established in France by Domingo de Guzman in 1216. Their official name
      was Fratres Predicatores, "Preaching Friars," and their chief objects were
      preaching and instruction. Their influence was very great until the rise
      of the Jesuit order in the sixteenth century. The Dominicans Le Maitre and
      Graverent (the Grand Inquisitor) both took part in the prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      89 31 FOR A LESS CAUSE THAN MARTYRDOM: Cf. Genesis ii. 24.

    <p>
      91 14 FROM THE FOUR WINDS: There may be a reminiscence here of Ezekiel

      belief that the good of France required it; two days later she paid the
      penalty, as she had expected, with her life.

      93 18 GRAFTON, A CHRONICLER: Richard Grafton died about 1572. He was
      printer to Edward VI. His chronicle was published in 1569.

    <p>
      9321 HOLINSHEAD: Raphael Holinshed died about 1580. His great work, <i>Chronicles
      of England, Scotland, and Ireland</i>, was used by Shakespeare as the
      source of several plays. He writes of Joan: "Of favor [appearance] was she
      counted likesome; of person stronglie made, and manlie; of courage, great,
      hardie, and stout withall."

    <p>
      94 (footnote) SATANIC: This epithet was applied to the work of some of his
      contemporaries by Southey in the preface to his <i>Vision of Judgement</i>,
      1821. It has been generally assumed that Byron and Shelley are meant. See
      Introduction to Byron's <i>Vision of Judgment</i> in the new Murray
      edition of Byron, Vol. IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      96 (footnote) BURGOO: a thick oatmeal gruel or porridge used by seamen.
      According to the <i>New English Dictionary</i> the derivation is unknown;
      but in the <i>Athenaeum</i>, Oct. 6, 1888, quoted by Hart, the word is
      explained as a corruption of Arabic <i>burghul</i>.

    <p>
      101 30 ENGLISH PRINCE, REGENT OF FRANCE: John, Duke of Bedford, uncle of
      Henry VI. "In genius for war as in political capacity," says J. R. Green,
      "John was hardly inferior to Henry [the Fifth, his brother] himself" (<i>A
      History of the English People</i>, Book IV, Chap. VI).
    </p>
    <p>
      101 31 MY LORD OF WINCHESTER: Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester,
      half-brother of Henry IV. He was the most prominent English prelate of his
      time and was the only Englishman in the Court that condemned Joan. As to
      the story of his death, to which De Quincey alludes, see Shakespeare, 2
      Henry VI, Act III, sc. in. Beaufort became cardinal in 1426.
    </p>
    <p>
      102 17 WHO IS THIS THAT COMETH FROM DOMRÉMY? This is an evident imitation
      of the famous passage from Isaiah Ixiii. I: "Who is this that cometh from
      Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?" "Bloody coronation robes" is rather
      obscure, but probably refers to the fact that Joan had shed her own blood
      to bring about the coronation of her sovereign; she is supposed to have
      appeared in armor at the actual coronation ceremony, and this armor might
      with reason be imagined as "bloody."
    </p>
    <p>
      102 22 SHE ... SHALL TAKE MY LORD'S BRIEF: that is, she shall act as the
      bishop's counsel. In the case of Beauvais, as in that of Winchester, it
      must be remembered that in all monarchical countries the bishops are
      "lords spiritual," on an equality with the greater secular nobles, the
      "lords temporal."

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
